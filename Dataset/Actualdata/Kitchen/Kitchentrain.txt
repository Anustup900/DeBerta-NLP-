 For those of you unfamiliar with the "A Series of Unfortunate Events" books, they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional Baudelaire orphans, and their struggles to overcome adversity (after adversity, after adversity, ad infinitum).  Hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional, brief glimpses of happiness, is their distant cousin, the scheming, greedy, conniving, ruthless cousin, the Count.For those of you unfamiliar with the "A Series of Unfortunate Events" books, they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional Baudelaire orphans, and their struggles to overcome adversity (after adversity, after adversity, ad infinitum).

It is a perfect fit, as is the casting of Jim Carrey as the Count
 i absolutely love this product. my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence. I hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking "arguments" with my dog. all barking and fighting has ceased. all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now
 I purchased 3 units and they work well for us.  I have 2 units in children's bedrooms on AC power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability.  The sound is clear and set-up and use is very easy.  The best thing about these units is the VOX answer option.  I have this option turned on in the kid's room and they merely have to answer back when I talk to them first without having to push the "talk" button.  This is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr. old that doesn't quite understand how to use this.  I attached a large, very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and I keep it on my fridge; but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary.  The only small annoying feature is every time the "talk" button is pressed, a beep occurs.  But the other features outweight that small annoyance for me
 I've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge.  After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model - picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon.  In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern. I've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge.

In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern. I must say, overall, I am quite pleased. While I am new to frying, I found it extraordinarily easy (it is pretty hot though, so be careful).  Only complaint would be that the capacity is a  little on the small side, say if you're cooking entrees for a larger family (for example, you can really only fit 3 (MAYBE 4) pieces of chicken at a time).  But since the chicken needs to cool down anyway, this wasn't such a major issue.  It came out nice, crispy, and golden brown - not too soggy, not too crisp - perfect.

 Easy to use, easy to clean. Two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy. This thing is easier to clean than my old George Foreman Grill (and that to me was a pain in the neck). The only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil, which I do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much I've used it and what I've cooked. If I'm doing just veggies, I keep the oil. If I do a meat or seafood, I'll change the oil right after. Very pleased overall.

 I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use.  It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times.  I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled
 used vet's RX to treat my dog's ear and it didnt seem to work. After reading reviews I decided to try this . After only 1 week I noticed a considerable amount of change in her ears for the better. would recommend to others
 I was so thrilled when I unpacked my processor.  It is  so high quality and professional in both looks and performance.  It has so many features that I love, especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time.  The egg beater attachment is excellent also.  I am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all
 The KitchenAid KFPW760 is exactly as advertised. It has three nested work bowls. The inner, smallest one takes a special blade (a smaller version of the standard processor blade). It's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things. Pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something. The same is true for the next one until you reach the largest, 12 cup bowl.The KitchenAid KFPW760 is exactly as advertised. It has three nested work bowls.

While it seems to work, it's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the Black & Decker, but what the heck, it's worth trying.A number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box (finally, a way to keep everything together).

 I love this bookcase. My only problem with it is that the bottom right side slat of wood arrived split (a bit), but it still fit together, so I kept it (excuse the rhymes, please). It's amazing that despite being somewhat broken it still holds 60 books, including some big heavy hardcovers, 20 DVDs, 3 DVD box sets, 12 videotapes, and a few pictures and knicknacks. And yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom. Best part: the ease with which you can put it together. I have MS, so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal. Highly recommended
 As a tea lover for 30 years, I have to say this electric kettle is the best one in terms of cost-benefit and performance. I've used this kettle for more than 1 year and it's still working perfectly. It boils water very quickly and keeps warm for a while. A+
 My only reservation is for safety sake, it would probably be better to get the version that is wireless, because when you fill this in the sink you must be very careful not to get the electrical prong that connects to the cord wet. 
 This kettle is amazing.  It's simple -- you plug it in and flip the switch (a light turns on to let you know it's working). This kettle is amazing.

Automatically cuts off after boiling for a minute, so no worries about fire hazards.  Great product, I use it every day.
 I love using them and when washed in fabric softener they are great.  It is a great deal.  Was kind of worried before purchase from reading some of the other reviews but after having had them a week, my whole family loves them.  They are much better than the more expensive famous designer towels that I have.  For people who are complaining about these towels, go price similar items at your local high end department stores
 Braun makes the best coffee makers and this feature makes it even better.  The coffee tastes more smooth because of this filter.  I love it
 great kit however the book that comes with the kit needs some work. The photos in the book are NOT accurate with the descriptions. I recommend that if you need canning instructions or recipes you get a separate book

 As a mathematician, game theorist, and proud Chi Omicron Chi (XOX, aka "Xocks") brother, I have always been interested in this the simplest of m,n,k games, i.e. games in which players alternate placing markers on an m x n board with each player trying to place k of his or her markers in a row.  As every game theorist knows, perfect tic-tac-toe play by both players results in a tie game every time, with neither player achieving victory.  The clever child will figure this out on her own, as I did at an early age, and I lost interest in playing tic-tac-toe before I turned five.  I never lost interest, however, in studying tic-tac-toe and similar games, which began my pursuit of mathematics and game theory, and partly accounts for my joining Chi Omicron Chi as a college freshman.  As part of our initiation, pledges had to play a modified form of tic-tac-toe with vodka-filled shot glasses for markers.  Each player had five glasses, and as he placed his marker, he would empty his glass.  The loser would drink the remaining shot glasses.  Most of us knew how to play perfect games of tic-tac-toe, so really the point of the game, as with most fraternity games, was to see who could best hold his liquor.  I do remember one unfortunate pledge, Bob, who never figured out how to play perfect tic-tac-toe and nearly drank himself into catatonia.As a mathematician, game theorist, and proud Chi Omicron Chi (XOX, aka "Xocks") brother, I have always been interested in this the simplest of m,n,k games, i.e. games in which players alternate placing markers on an m x n board with each player trying to place k of his or her markers in a row.

I have a four-year-old son who has yet to perfect his tic-tac-toe game, so I bought this set to educate him.  We play the same way I did in the Xocks fraternity house.  Of course I don't give him pure vodka in his shot glasses; he only weighs 35 lbs.  As 35 lbs represents approximately a fifth of my own weight, I dilute his vodka in a 1-to-4 dilution with orange juice.  I know what you're thinking: what happens when he loses and must finish off the remaining shot glasses, including mine?  I am nothing if not fair, so when he loses, I give him an equivalent amount of diluted vodka to however much pure vodka I have remaining in my shot glasses.  Since I, knowing how to play perfect tic-tac-toe, never lose to my son, the reverse problem, my having to drink his remaining shots, never occurs.All these thoughts came rushing, so to speak, back to me when I saw the "Shot Glasses Tic-Tac-Toe" available for so reasonable a price at about a dollar per component.

You would think all this negative reinforcement would promote rapid and forceful mastery of tic-tac-toe, but his cognitive development must be lacking.  I can only surmise that the time delay between his losing tic-tac-toe games and the negative effects of alcohol poisoning inhibits his forming the negatively reinforcing connections.  He still loves to play, however, but his game, if anything, seems to be getting worse, almost as if he is trying to lose
 These knives are great.  They are very sharp and of high quality. 
 I thought I couldn't live without my Cuisinart or Kitchen Aide - this product goes on the same list!!!  This was the easiest, best performing kitchen &quot;gizmo&quot; I have ever had.  A must for entertaining and holiday baking - simple, easy - no mess!  Gone are the days with the &quot;one at a time&quot; with the gas burner!!  Love it, love it!!
 This is my third pair of kitchen shears.  The first was $10 and lasted a week.  I thought the second pair was just fine until my Shun shears arrived.  These cut well and are also very smooth while cutting.  They fit my hand nicely. I can really feel the difference in quality.  These can perform different functions -- opening bottles, jar opener, nut cracker -- one blade has a curve in it to accomodate bone.  I love that they are dishwasher safe.This is my third pair of kitchen shears.  The first was $10 and lasted a week.  I thought the second pair was just fine until my Shun shears arrived.

 The knife is solid and very comfortable in hand, however, when I got it new, the blade is slightly bent. I expect it to be in almost Perfect condition, but it's not
 This knife is well worth the money.  It is not only sharp but it behaves in your hand begging to be tuned loose on meat vegetables, fruit you name it.  Honestly, I felt it was too much for me but as I got better accustomed to its heft, I knew it was me that did not possess the skills to wield the tool.   Do not doubt yourself, learning to use it is a joy.  Treat yourself
 I really like this tea press. It is the perfect size for one person.

 I had never used a pizza stone but, thought they might be fun so, I put one on my registry. I made pizza on the stone using store bought dough and got rave reviews from friends. Would definately reccomend this to a friend! Just remember to let the stone heat thoroughly before using.
 I purchased this machine for my father, who is completely blind, but a complete coffee fiend.  He finds this machine easy to use, and loves the fact that he can make as many or as few cups.  I highly recommend this machine
 Heavy duty and scratch resistant (my husband always tests this with his house key). Good value for the money

 This is a perfect machine for the office. It takes up very little space,is very simple to use, cleaning is a breeze.You can fill the water tank so that water is ready when you are for a cup of delicious coffee.I purchased this coffee maker for my husband's office and for my wallet.In his building there is a coffee shop but at $[...] a cup and time away from the desk 1 half hour per cup this was an expensive habit.The Melitta paid for itself in a few days. You can't go wrong with this produc
 I ordered all three colors of these mugs - red, blue and white.  The blue and white mugs have a shiny, even glaze.  The red glaze is mottled and has more of a matte finish, giving it a more rustic, country look.  The mugs are great but the three different colors look very different and really don't match each other. 
 Works well, well built and easy to clean.  Have no problems after a few months of use
 I have used this filter daily for over a year and love it. At first I tried using it in a "Mr. Coffee" style machine, but found that my coffee grind was too fine and the water would filter through too slowly and overflow if I made more than 2 cups.

 Me being an avid coffee drinker I will have to say if you want a quick cup it does the job.  For the money its cheap and provides a quick cup but you better have good coffee I used the pods and found it to be weak at time and sometimes you need a stronger cup I think more brewing is better.  Sometimes was a bit messy water all over the place but maybe Im a bull in a china shop would recommend the item I spent more on starbucks in a week
 This may sound odd, but this is the first steamer that I have ever had. So needless to say, I do not have others to compare it to. However,I find that I use it more than I thought I would! The unfolded steamer fits perfectly in the pot that I most use for vegies and the like, and when I pull out the sides (the steaming tray) it fits nicely up the sides of the pot. Besides your basic steamed vegies, I find that it's perfect for warming up leftovers like rice, leaving it hot and fluffy. I like that the handle extends, so you can keep the cover on it while cooking, but you can extend the handle for easier lifting. And you can't beat the price
 So I read all your reviews previous to my purchase on this AND was skeptical. There were many reviewers that complained about cracks and problems holding an air-tight seal. MINE WORK PERFECTLY! They are invaluable and I'm glad I bought two of these canisters. Are you people sending the canisters through the dishwasher? If so, stop it! The intense heat will eventually crack anything made of plastic. Do you have an OLD model vacuum sealer? Maybe that's the problem - a performance issue. I have the newer stainless steel V2860 and you couldn't pry that out of my hands! I would give it 10 stars if there was such a rating.So I read all your reviews previous to my purchase on this AND was skeptical.

I would give it 10 stars if there was such a rating.Today, I give this product 5 stars. Like most products - only time will tell how well they will hold out in the long run
 At first I thought I wouldn't be able to decide what to use this for, but right away I remembered that I just bought a six pack of onion rolls and they always seemed to have to be frozen and were just not the same later or went moldy in the fridge, so I vacuum sealed them in this and they were good to the last one with no flavor change at all.  Yummy! ;7
 I love this wok.  Heavy duty compared to woks you buy at oriental stores.  I highly recommend it
 At first I was turned off by the bright (gaudy) colors.  However, I have learned to appreciate that these knives are color-coded! They stand out in the knife drawer, and you can always find the one you are looking for.  Consequently, the right knife is used to get the job done.The knives are indestructable and durable.  We have owned ours 4-5 years and they show no unusual wear. Put them into the dishwasher!  We don't do that with another knife (regretted it when we have), but these can take it. The knives are well-designed for function, comfortable to handle, strong, & sharp.We love them and gave sets to our adult kids who always are commenting on how useful they are. Friends that visit and use ours comment favorably on them.These aren't showy knives for formal dining nor will they impress anyone with your classy style.  However, they do impress everyone who uses them.  And, the price is nice
 I have had these knives for about 6 months now and could not be happier.  They have excellent balance and feel.  A major improvement to the stamped knives that comes with the Calphalon 15 piece set.  The wood storage tray that comes with the knives is not very nice (light pine with no finish), but I don't use it anyway
 Delighted to have it for my wood floors, tile and area rugs. Works great picking up cat fur and other organic and non-organic detritus that collects. Does require emptying the fur catcher and cleaning the brush regularly - gosh darn! So much easier to do that than taking a broom or dust mop to the entire house. Also have to set up the virtual walls and carry it upstairs and down, when I want to change areas being cleaned. Again, gosh darn! Can't totally eliminate ALL the work, no matter how much I might like to.Delighted to have it for my wood floors, tile and area rugs.

 This Dutch Oven is a workhorse in my kitchen.  I purchased it pre-seasoned because I've never had a factory-seasoned piece of cast iron cookware.  Bottom line:  While the pre-seasoning was a plus, it's not necessary.  Just follow the seasoning instructions that come with all the Lodge cookware, and you'll be fine.This Dutch Oven is a workhorse in my kitchen.

The lid on this oven also fits the 12-inch skillet which I own, and that's a plus.  It conducts heat well and when I use it camping as an oven, breads and biscuits come out as well as at home.

 This is the second one of these I've purchased (the first was a Thermos branded one without the cover). It keeps my can of soda, etc cold throughout and adds a touch of class to keeping it on my desk. Both of these are VERY rugged and I would highly recommend over a standard foam cooler. Absolutely the most functional, effective, and classy cooler I've ever had!
 The Nissan Multi-Function Can Insulator is a lightweight versatile stainless steel holder that effectively keeps canned beverages cold. My mother and I find the product allows our soft drinks to remain cold after more than two hours. I have two conveniently stored in the center console of my automobile, 1 at the office, and 1 in my luggage for travel.
 Just used my pan last night and as always with Lodge Logic Pans they were awesome!  I highly recommend them.  =
 I'm sure that you will love this set as much as my family and I do!Each piece is durable and good looking!  My original set was also by Sango, and I gave it away after 20 years only because my decor had changed dramactically.  Now my neighbor is enjoying my original service for 12.  I expect to enjoy my new Gold Dust set for at least, the next 20 years
 When we got married 7 years ago, we were given a hand mixer of another brand (Sunbeam, I think) that had seven (or was it nine?) speeds and lots of different attachments (dough hook, wisk, etc., none of wich worked well).  I have a hard time remembering exact spefications because it died after 6 months, and I hadn't even mixed anything heavy with it!  I always mixed most of my flour into things by hand to try to spare the motor (my mom had burnt through several mixers).So we went to the store, and for $30 we could get another cheap brand with many speeds and fancy gadgets (several brands & models available), or we could get this Kitchenaid with one set of beaters and three speeds.  I chose this simple Kitchaid and have never been sorry.This little hand mixer takes it all--even stiff cookie dough like roll-out sugar cookies.  And it mixes every last bit of the flour in.  Beaters don't clog, dough mixes up smooth.I plan on someday getting a bigger kitchenaid, but so far haven't needed it.  If you are on a budget, and need to get the most power for your penny, this is the best purchase you could possibly make
 I have owned a lot of crappy toasters and actually haven't gotten another for the past 6 years. I've resorted to pan toasting in order to avoid another bad purchase. Finally got tired of so much effort for toast and broke down and got this toaster. It's so easy to use and it even defrosts frozen bread and can warm up an already toasted slice without retoasting. Worked amazingly well to heat a cold slice of pizza but I'm sure Braun is cringing if they read this! I love the little pull out tray, you don't have to pick up the whole darn thing and hold it over the sink and beat it to death! The toast comes out very even and perfectly toasted every time. Slots are wide too so a bagel is no problem. It is fast too, so you won't miss it not being a 4 slice toaster. I think you will be pleased with this great toaster, I am
 The Braun HT500 is one of the best designed toasters I have ever used. What I really like....The Braun HT500 is one of the best designed toasters I have ever used. What I really like....1. A single long & wide slot, allowing you to toast large or unusually shaped pieces of bread. I have used it to toast very thick pieces of bread, long hoagee rolls, and those huge hamberger buns that won't fit in a standard toaster slot.1.

But you'd be surprised how some very expensive toasters I've used in the past were often poor in this area.Of all those items, the first one is by far the most important. Strangely however, few manufacturers today make a long & wide toaster any longer.  Braun is one of the few that does.  That fact combined with the great design is reason for me to give it a hearty recommendation
 Great blender! I use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails. Powerful motor purees frozen fruits great!! Simple--only two speeds. Easy clean-up
 I have only used this blender once, but already I love it.  I will update my review if anything changes.  No more cheapo blenders for me!  I have tried Oster (really bad), and Black and Decker from Walmart (a tad better, but it didn't work on frozen fruit and ice).I have only used this blender once, but already I love it.

Fifth, the blades are built into the stainless steel container, and it's a snap to clean.

 The temperature readings were spot on.There are multiple ways to display it, hang it from the shelves in your oven, place it on the bottom of your oven. it's very stable, doesn't fall over, mostly because of it's 4 inch length.There are multiple ways to display it, hang it from the shelves in your oven, place it on the bottom of your oven. it's very stable, doesn't fall over, mostly because of it's 4 inch length.BUT... as with all things in the oven, this will become splattered with grease, and harder to read, and you'll want to wash it....DON'T!BUT... as with all things in the oven, this will become splattered with grease, and harder to read, and you'll want to wash it....DON'T!any type of cleaning, be it abrasive , or chemical, such as Simple Green, will erase the temperature markings... and make it useless
 This ice cream Maker is "GREAT".  The fact that I can use an industrial motor (my kitchen Aid mixer) is fantastic.  It is my belief that the ice cream maker itself is as near perfect as you can get, contrary to other reviews.  If you read the description and instructions, you will find that it is not the biggest maker on the market AND that it does EXACTLY what it says it will...IT MAKES "GREAT" ICE CREAM.
 I love this pan.  As for cooking: This pan does a great job on steaks, burgers, chicken, whatever. Leaves really nice grill marks. The only thing you will need to do is have a cover or splatter shield for it.  I use a 16" round cover from a much bigger pan just to avoid some of the little drops of grease spattering out on my range.  This seems to work just find for me.I love this pan.

I repeat this once or twice and put the pan back on the heat and wipe it down with a paper towel.  I then use some supermarket brand canola oil spray and lightly coat the inside while the pan is still warm. Takes about 2 minutes to do this.  I store this pan in my oven since it tends to have a light coat of oil on it all the time. This pan is so well worth the hand cleaning to have especially since I live in an apartment and don't have access to a grill
 The Diadem cooking set roughly meets the WMF criteria, though there are slight imperfections on the metal and the top. The products are made im China. At first I thought something was wrong, then I looked at the WMF site and indeed they have a factury in China, so they must be genuine, however, I think Amazon should clearly state if they are made in China or Germany, I ordered another WMF kettle last week, made in Germany and I think there is a differenc
 I did not find a problem with the balance, as previously mentioned by another reviewer. The only thing a potential buyer needs to be aware of is, that if they are planning on tossing their food, they had better be strong because this unit is heavy! Other than that, it proves to be very useful for large portions. It heats quickly, heats evenly, holds the heat and leaves plenty of room to stir. Yes, it does heat evenly and allows the heat to drift up the sides. The purpose of a stirfry pan is to allow heat to move the sides of the pan to allow food touching the sides of the pan to cook as well. Now keep in mind, there isnt a perfect stirfry pan out on the market if you are cooking on a traditional gas top, flat top or coil range. True frying ala Asian style is done on an open flame! 
 Calphalon Katana knives excel in balance, efficient design, sharpness, and in good looks. I look forward to using them every time I prepare food
 This is simply the best pan I own. *IF* you follow the directions on how to cook with this pot, you won't have a problem with sticking. It's easy to use, easy to clean, works for just about everything (except maybe making pancakes - for which you would want a non-stick griddle). I just love being able to use metal utensils with this pot and not having to worry about scratching it. LOVE it
 Reliable, easy to use, rice always comes out perfectly, no burning, easy to clean - what more could you ask of a rice cooker
 Le Creuset's grills, woks, and frying pans come with a textured black enamel that needs to be "Seasoned" like tradiitonal cast iron. There are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this. Basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan, the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes. Let the pan cool, remove the oil with a paper towel, and repeat two or three times. A surface "patina" builds up that is quite non-stick. From now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel. In the case of burned-on food, a brief soak in soapy water works well. As the pan is used the patina continues to build.  Le Creuset's omelete pans do come with silverstone non-stick if you like non-stick.  The textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non-stick coating.  I own a Le Creuset Wok, a square grill pan, and three frying pans with this textured finish and I find that they work fine after being seasoned this way. I also own a Le Creuset Omlete pan that has a good non-stick coating. This pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations. The textured finish pans work well for grilling meats, stir fries, and other hardier preparations.  If you use good non-scratch silicone or nylon tools in your Le Creuset wares and a small amout of PAM or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems.
 This is a super convenient item. I don't lock it so messing with the lock is not an issue. The lock could probably be a little more user friendly. It stores everything just great. It keeps the dust off of my Cuisinart goodies. I have another three-blade disc holder too. That one came with my Cuisinart. This  one is a must-have.
 I am glad that I finally have a storage unit to hold my sharp Cuisinart Blades.  I have three little kids and the thought of them getting their little hands on them always had me worried.  The only design flaw is that it can be difficult to open and then lock back into place.  I knew this going into my purchase and decided to take the chance as the flaw was better then not having to worry about my children.I am glad that I finally have a storage unit to hold my sharp Cuisinart Blades.

 I got this as a gift from my mother when I moved to my first apartment away from home. She already had one, and loved it.  I use mine quite frequently, and makes quick work of dicing onions and peppers for philly steaks or burgers.  My brother and father have also since purchased these units.  I have had mine going on 5 years now, not a problem with it.  great value, good gift for cooks for one or two, who do not need a huge unit to chop stuff. 
 My mother-in-law got me one of these when I started feeding my first son baby food.  Before, I would just mash up our food with a fork.  This is much easier. I've had it for three years now and it's still working great.   My mother-in-law got me one of these when I started feeding my first son baby food.  Before, I would just mash up our food with a fork.  This is much easier. I've had it for three years now and it's still working great.   I use it for everything, now.  My husband doesn't like veggies, and I when I cook I usually put onion, celery, and bell pepper in everything.  Now we get the taste of my beloved vegtables, and he doesn't have to deal with the chunks.  Great product!

 This electric water heater feels very solid and well built. When filled to 1.7 liters, it takes about 6 min 30 seconds to boil. The kettle automatically shuts off when it boils and makes a nice bell noise when finished. I thought this would be annoying, but it is not! Also, when switched on, there is a nice white LED lighting up the water supply making it easy to read.This electric water heater feels very solid and well built.

A few moments after the switch is turned on, it makes this rumbling noise for the entire duration of operation
 I love this fryer! Its just the right size for my kitchen.Its not big and bulky like other fryers. Its easy to clean too. Its a winner in my book
 I knew going in that these were not "thick", but I am pleased with these sheets.  Would I buy them again? Yes, aslong as the price is as low as I got them for (under 20 bucks)
 These sheets are soft wash well and set the pace for a great night's sleep.  I love flannel sheets and these are the best so far. 
 This thing tears through meat, I hate to chewy beef and stringy chicken, so this attachment is my new bud. Works fantastic on cereal to (dry not wet). Buy it, you won't regret it
 I ordered this item when it was not available at that time so it took a while for me to get it-but I was impressed at the careful packing and the product itself-very elegant looking cake set and can be used as a punch bowl too-would certainly recommend it for all hosts
 I recieved this cake plate a couple weeks ago. it's very heavy and well made. it came boxed extra well. The box was inside another box surrounded by air bags.  There was no way this thing was going to be broken. I am happy with my purchase
 Lodge logic has exploded from a small corner shop in one lonely town in Vermont, to a nationwide powerhouse ready and eager to bust down to the door to your house and fill your kitchen with finest in waffle press technology.  I'm of course referring to the cutting edge Finnish design that lodge has presented here.  I'm able to pretty much press out an entire course of breakfast in well under an hour with this thing, easily producing a feast fit for the third reich. 
 Pyrex is always the best!  This enormous measuring cup is great for melting in the microwave and for a homemade double boiler in any pot.  The lid is a hard plastic top with flexible sides that seal up tight so you can use it to store things in the fridge and to carry things places.  Also the cover is safe for both freezer and microwave use (but not the oven) and is dishwasher safe in the top rack.  The cover has three pouring choices, a regular pour spout, a slotted spout, and a spout with seven little holes.  An extremely useful item to have in the kitchen
 Even if you aren't worried about the possible negative effects of drinking out of plastic or nalgene this is the best water bottle ever.   If you want a water bottle that keeps your water cold all day long, doesn't sweat, is unbreakable, doesn't spill and won't let water dribble down you chin put your nalgene and plastic ones away and buy this one now. 
 Ok, this is obviously not the same as the traditional All Clad stockpots, if it was it would be more then triple the price of this one. It is part of the disk bottom collection, however it is still top quality stainless steel and very well made. I certainly would not consider it secondary. It is a little lighter in weight than the traditional All Clad but it is not a light weight pot by any means. It is great for sauce, soup, stew, etc. You will love it and you can't beat the price. It is very easy to clean. A+ Keep an eye out, there is always some kind of rebate or gift with most cooking purchases both on Amazon and in department and cooking stores.  I actually got this stock pot free when I purchased my All-Clad Roti Pan set which also came with a rack and turkey lifters in Filene's.  I would have bought it anyway, it is an excellent stockpot and the price can't be beat.  Tip: If you should get something stuck to the stainless steel use a product called "Bar Keepers Friend" to clean it. Most supermarkets have it and Kitchen Etc. and Bed, Bath and Beyond carry it too. The container (like a Comet can) is gold with blue and white writing. All Clad recommends it for cleaning stainless steel and it works like a dream and is very inexpensive. 
 This cover is very rich looking. The fabric is wonderful. I have a kitten that was pulling himself onto the bed and snagging it, but I just snipped the snags and you cannot tell. It is easy to wash and looks great on the bed
 I have enjoyed using my Mario Baltali enamaled cast pot very much, it cooks beautifully and holds a large amount
 I searched for years trying to find a nice, plain white butter dish. This one is perfect -- it blends in well with all my other dishes. It is study, attractive, and holds a stick of butter. What more could you ask of a butter dish
 Fiestaware ROCKS.  A few years back, I started my Fiestaware collection. The butter dish, in turquoise, was a recent addition.  I like the vibrant colors available which allow for a cheerful, eclectic mix or a more coordinated theme. It is of the highest quality and very durable in the oven as well.  I am going to put glass doors on my cabinets to showcase my Fiestaware because not only is it practical and beautiful, they are individual pieces of art! 
 This grater has quickly become the favorite in my kitchen. It's very solidly built, unlike the old ones I have, and the non-skid base is pure genius. The grating surface is nice and sharp. I love the container that catches whatever you've grated and then stores any extras with an airtight lid. Although the container faithfully catches the grated material, there will be some spillage - from the outside of the grater - especially with cheese. One caveat: Since the container stores upside down inside the grater when not in use, you have to remember to remove it and flip it over before grating. Yup, I realized this the hard way, and boy was it a mess! Despite this, I highly recommend this kitchen essential
 This set has 29 tips, a flower nail and one coupler in a plastic case. All the tips and more to decorate just about any cake you would make. 
 This knife works nicely. The blades have remained sharp after carving roasted chicken and turkey, roast beef, and yes even cakes over the past year.This knife works nicely. The blades have remained sharp after carving roasted chicken and turkey, roast beef, and yes even cakes over the past year.The handle wipes off cleanly after use and doesn't suffer from the  extreme electric motor vibration that so many electric knives have. The handle stays cool as well. I don't have anything bad to say about this item, it has been a true performer
 This is a very nice set of small measuring spoons-- excellent for measuring baking soda, salt, etc for recipes. They are very sturdy and much better than the inexpensive plastic products you find at the discount stores. This set also comes with 2 things not shown, a nice ring to loop these together, as well as a matching S hook to hang them up when not in use. I really like this set and would recommend this to everyone
 This Toastmaster breadmaker is pretty basic, makes a good-sized loaf and is really easy to use. If the first loaf isn't perfect, the troubleshooting section of the book tells you how to correct the problems and the corrections work.It's been in use constantly for weeks now and never fails to produce a good loaf
 Had I known what a difference this would make with my cooking, I would have bought one a long time ago. Everything is faster, now, and everything I mix, from potatoes to icing, comes out smoother, too. There are a variety of things you can make with this mixer, and I use mine a lot. Perhaps not every single day, but almost. I bake bread with it every few days, and I decorate cakes for parties and special occasions on the side. My mixer has never let me down. In fact, I am buying an extra bowl just for convenience, too. Sometimes you do get a strange smell when you use it to whip something up. They even tell you in your mixer's manual to expect it and that it is normal. I've had mine for almost a year, now, and was waiting until I had it awhile before I reviewed it. But I have yet to have any problems with it. It's cut preparation time more than half for everything I've made with it. From cakes to meatloaf and bread. It's sturdy and somewhat heavy, which means it's not going to easily be knocked off your counter. It does have a slow start to prevent flour from going all over. However, if you are using a lot of powdered sugar or flour to the point of it being more than half full, you will still want to use the stir speed until it's a little more settled and moist or you will end up with a mess. Not a big one, but a mess nonetheless. It comes with a book of recipes, but I've only used a few. I've never had any issues with it handling all the cookie dough and other heavy doughs I've mixed with it, however. In fact, I've made more cookies just since getting this than I did for years before. It's just so convenient and easy that I don't mind. I mean heavy doughs, too, like monster cookies and peanut butter m&m cookies, etc. I don't know what else to say about it. I don't think you will be disappointed in this purchase. I'm usually someone who doesn't like to spend a lot of money, but this was more than worth it, and I will be buying my daughter one someday, too
 The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere.

 I purchased this mug for my wife as a Christmas gift. She just loves it. She useds almost everyday. It has been 4 months now and as good as new.
 These pans are great, nothing sticks to them. I baked a pie, set on top of the pan, and the burnt overflow stuff just slid right off
 These sheets are wonderful and very well made.  I really like they way they feel.  Great, great value!
 Great price for beautiful, high-quality sheets that get softer with every wash. Fabulous color! Sheets fit well over a mattress with pillow-top. Recommend 100%.Great price for beautiful, high-quality sheets that get softer with every wash. Fabulous color! Sheets fit well over a mattress with pillow-top. Recommend 100%.
 OK, for twenty bucks it works reasonably well.  We like the storage container to hold the attachments.  But if you're looking for a lower speed to blend ingredients like flour or pancake mix, buy something else.  The #1 speed setting is way too fast.  Anything higher than #4 will decorate your kitchen walls "at no extra charge".

So far I don't have any complaints about this hamilton beach model.  It is powerful enough to whip up the potatoes.  It comes with a case that fits right onto the bottom of the mixer that holds the cord and the beaters.  This is wonderful since I no longer have to search through the drawers looking for the beaters.So far I don't have any complaints about this hamilton beach model.

 I love this spatula.  When it comes to getting the last bit of dough or sauce out of the bottom of a bowl, it's perfect.  The soft silicone head easily contours itself to the bottom of the bowl  to get every last bit.  It's also incredibly stick free.  I made fondue last night and after pouring it all into the serving dish, I wiped the cheese off the spoon with a finger, rinsed it, and it was clean!  It is also incredibly heat resistent.  My household has a lot of spatulas with burn marks all along the handle from resting on the side of a pot on the stove.  I've had this spatula for over two years and it's still burn free.  I love it
 Cleaning up is so easy now.  The other roaster pan we used would allow the juices to bake on and it you would have to soak it, scrub it and scrape it.  I love this stuff!
 This is one great tool.  I have this as well as the scoop and they are both great items.  I like the spade better since I LOVE ice cream and it makes it easier to fill the bowl quicker. The style is great and the functionality is superb.  Now that Kitchenaid is making tools and gadgets, I am finding myself getting all new sorts of items I never knew I wanted or needed.  I'm even replacing other brands of tools with Kitchenaid ones
 Super easy to use, put in rice and water.  Out comes perfect rice every time.  Haven't experimented with any rice cooking recipes yet but it makes incredible white and brown rice with no though. 
 Just go for new shaped cookies, these cutters are great and so simple to use
 The only reason I bought this is because I visited my sister over the Holiday Season and she had one and I liked it.   I liked it even more after I bought it.   Nice toaster!!
 Its the perfect size pan and easy to clean. I've cooked Thai stayle Chicken Satay sticks and salmon on it and it makes those awesome grill lines. I love using this pan...its so much easier & faster than using then firing up the outdoor grill.
 This handheld vac works great. There is awesome suction and longevity. I had two dustbusters that didn't come close so I am now a convert. Only complaint is the stand used for charging. It's not easy to push vacuum into just the right spot
 This vacuum is rather good. It meets or exceeds the dustbuster versions. I've got only one gripe, and that's the base. It isn't exactly easy to put on and take off. It could also do with a bigger compartment, but that's really minor. After all, this is just for small tasks.Love the motorized sweeper attachment
 I HAVE USED DIFFERENT BRANDS OF DUST BUSTERS BUT THIS ONE BY FAR HAS OUT DONE THEM. THE BATTERY LASTS AND THE POWER IS VERY GOOD. ALSO SHIPPING WAS PROMPT. NOTHING ELSE I CAN ADD. ALL OVER VERY GOOD. THANK YOU, I SHALL RETURN. A.F. ISLAND PAR
 I have bought over 6 of these for friends and family, everyone that sees it, has to have one, we make alot of our own jewelry, so we have plenty of bracelets and earrings.  This keeps it organized so you can match colors to the outfit you are wearing.  It is the best!  Very good quality too
 I am happy with the product quality and with the prompt delivery.The organizer is made of sturdy materials and comes on a very nice chrome hanger
 This grill is awesome! I ordered it to replace my old grill, which didn't have the removeable plates and was worn down. The removeable grills make this so easy to clean...maybe takes 5 minutes. I had looked at a couple of other contact grills from different manufacturers, and though this one was more expensive, I thought it had a better design than some of the others I looked it. Definitely recommended, don't hesitate to buy this if you're thinking about it
 I bought this item and had it delivered about a month and a half ago.  It arrived in perfect condition with all the items it says it will come with.  It's very easy to use and extremely easy to clean.  So far I have only cooked whole chickens, chicken pieces, shishkabobs, and sausages.  If I only ever used it to just cook chicken, it's still a great price.  If you can follow simple instructions, you can't go wrong with this
 When I was searching for something to simplify my life I came upon this product.  I thought I would give it a try as I love egg mcmuffins.  It is everything I dreamed of and more.  Easy, convient, done in less than five minutes and a breeze to clean up.  I love it and can't stop telling family and friends about it.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have
 This is great for making poached eggs on toast.  My family has enjoyed using it so far
 My cats absolutely love this fountain.  It works great, and takes very little to keep clean.  The resovoir is a must though
 Like many homemakers, I generally leave fixture installation to the man of the house.  My husband refused to drill into our metal doors in order to install conventional curtain rods.  I went without curtains over our kitchen doorway for years and always felt that something was missing.  These magnetic curtain rods solved that problem.  The rod holders attach magnetically without screws or bolts.  The holders have never shifted out of place and have not scuffed or scratched my door.  The curtain rods are stable enough to hold heavy canvas curtains. I installed the set in a moment's time with very little effort.  My husband was surprised and thrilled that I found a way to hang curtains without marring the metal surface of the door.
 I saw this unit on vacation and came home and bought one.  That was several years ago.  Finally, our beloved brewstation gave up the ghost and went on to coffeeland in the sky.  So, I promptly bought another one.  Morning is just not the same without our brewstation
 Tried this on my favorite but often dull chefs knife and after 4-6 strokes was very very sharp.  Works great as promised.  casing cheap so not sure how long that will last or if it will hamper it's operation. compact, stores well, would be great for motor home or other small kitchen.  For $29, makes me wonder what the $99 version does that Amazon also carries. knocked a star off for the cheap plastic case
 3 swipes and your knife is sharp on both sides of the edge. The sharpener folds up neatly into a little case the size of a man's wallet and is easy to store. The Handy House ships immediately..I got my package within 3 days. I love the knife sharpener, and love the service I received. Thank
 I bought this knife sharpener because I was tired of knives that would not cut & the vender I brought it from, The Handy House, told me that it worked and I had bought things from her before on her word. And it works. My knifes are old & dull. A few swips through the sharpener blade & I had a brand new knife & the price is also good.
 These spoons are great.  They are very sturdy and easy to use, and the finish on the metal is a nice touch.  Overall, practical and attractive
 this set of knives is simply incredible - a MUST for any kitchen, especially a small one or if you just do a lot of quick small tasks.  these things are SHARP, and, as standard for henckels, supremely made. 
 I know that purists don't like serrated knives, but these are great!  The weight of these knives is perfect--they feel like very expensive utensils.  The chef's knife is rarely out of my hand, and the block makes the whole set very handy
 Was thrilled to find pieces to replace ones mistakenly thrown out, rather than have to buy another blender.  The only drawback is the cover is white and my blender is black
 this set of blender accessories was just what i needed to update my old blender.  seperatly these items become more costly but here they are at a great value and shopping is made easy because this set has it all 
 this is my first Le Creuset casserole. When I first received it, it was smaller than i was expecting. But after cooking with it couple times, I really fall in love with it! Now I always clean it after using, and have it on my stove top in the kitchen! it's so cute and fun
 This is probably the most used tool in my kitchen. The cost of the machine and bag material are more than repaid in food savings. I like the rolls as opposed to the bags because I can make the size I need without waste. Watch for sales on meat or fish; buy large quantities at reduced cost, and cut your bags to a portion size, vacuum and seal, and freeze. I have taken hamburger, steaks, fish, pork, and chicken out of the freezer after being stored for two years or longer, and they are as fresh as the day I put them in
 I got this pan set a few years ago.  I love making checkerboard cakes--they are so simple with this set.  You can use boxed mixes, but I find the thicker consistency of the sample recipe makes a more distinct checkerboard design.  I got this pan set a few years ago.

My favourite variation is to make blue and pink for baby showers instead of brown and white. (I make the white cake and just use  food colouring). 
 Jeez, everyone, yea, they cost a buck each, ok, a buck! but they can be reused, how often do you go to the dollar store and spend a buck on a  totally usless piece of something that breaks as soon as you bring it home, hmmm? or you buy a pack of paper plates and they are gone in a couple of weeks?? Well, at least these are serving a purpose, and are reusable....I don't have to scoop anymore, and I have 2 cats, I change it maybe every 3rd day, and it's not a chore, takes less than a minute, less time than scooping and smelling it as it sits there,  and speaking of, I do not smell their poop at all till it's changed. so I'm happy and I think it's more than worth it!
 We were more than pleased with our purchase of this item, and it arrived sooner than expected.It was very very nice and well worth the great discounted price we received it for.
 for the money this is a way for the novice cook to experience the quality of wustof. This knife went into my daughter in law's stocking for Christmas and was a great hit
 My old blender went kaput it was a kenmore. We decided to buy this blender since it also had a small food processor. The food processor has become our most frequently used tool. Preparing salsa, omlettes, indian food which requires vegetables chopped into small pieces, pancakes and numerous other tasks have become so easy that we make more vegetarian dishes now and they taste better since the pieces are well and evenly chopped.Really enjoyed the blender during the summer months when we made fresh juices etc. Unlike the old kenmore one this one blends much better.Really enjoyed the blender during the summer months when we made fresh juices etc. Unlike the old kenmore one this one blends much better.I recommend this to any one who does not want to spend money on an expensive food processor or does not have the counter space in the kitchen for all the apparatus that comes with a big food processor.I recommend this to any one who does not want to spend money on an expensive food processor or does not have the counter space in the kitchen for all the apparatus that comes with a big food processor.
 This is a jewel. Takes the skin off nice and clean. Just the tool to get rid of those tough skins on a few tomatoes and no more fuzzy peaches. Just bought 6 more for family and friends.
 This is a great shredder.  Absolutly the best out there.  It is a lousy slicer.  Take the bad with the good I guess.This is a great shredder.  Absolutly the best out there.  It is a lousy slicer.

 First, the good stuff: this peeler is sharp, requires little effort in peeling away even the toughest skins and seems quite durable. I like having it, but I'm also holding on to my cheap little Oxo peeler for a couple of reasons: first, the Rosle produces very thick peels, which is a bit wasteful. Second, I tend to be a switch hitter in terms of peeling direction and really like having a peeler that can either peel toward me or away from me. The Rosle peels in only one direction and thus sells both a right-handed and left-handed peeler. That said, I do appreciate its sold stainless steel construction, which will resist rust for many more years than lesser models
 Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products. These cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products. These cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat. Due to this efficiency, it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat.  Over heating may cause foods to stick to the pan, or worse burn and can cause the enamel to appear stained.  Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. The opposite holds true as well, chill the pan and it will retain its chill for a surprisingly long time.  Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials. Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat.

Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials. Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit contact to heat resistant plastic or wood utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain.

The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the French oven, Cocotte or as it's also referred to, the Dutch oven specifically.  French ovens have been manufactured by Le Creuset for over 75 years, and were developed well before then.  In all this time the design has stayed constant, affirming the relevance of its cooking qualities.  These ovens come in either oval or round shapes.  The oval shape works well for roasting whole chickens and porkloin roasts, otherwise the differences are minimal.The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the French oven, Cocotte or as it's also referred to, the Dutch oven specifically.

The domed lid provides a tight seal, trapping in moisture to roll back into the dish.  The lid may alternatively be used as a holding plate for chopped vegetables or meat during initial preparations.  Be sure to lift the pan off of cooking surfaces to reduce damaging either the pan or the surface.  French oven tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot.  French ovens were developed for slow cooking by stewing, braising or boiling.  Some typical dishes include roasts, and stews.  Other possibilities include gumbos, chili, dirty rice, baked beans, Swedish meatballs, osso bucco, or curing ice cream to name a few.French ovens were developed for slow cooking by stewing, braising or boiling.

The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to the old cast iron pans past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of.

 This pot rocks.  You'll fall in love with it the first time you cook with it.  It browns well, cleans easily, and goes from the stove to the oven to the table in style. This pot rocks.

My only complaint is that mine arrived slightly chipped, but the chips don't seem to affect its performance, so I didn't send it back
 This product is great for making mashed potatoes.  I love it, it is well made and sturdy.  My kids like to turn the handle and I do not have to worry about any electric blades cutting their fingers.  The price is very good for this item. I prefer non electric kitchen gadgets, (to save space) and this one is great.
 I used the four large slider discs to move an 8' x 10' gambrel roofed framed shed a few feet on a cement pad (after building the mini-barn & painting it).  The move placed it against the fence.  It wasn't easy, but they did the job and......the slider discs are still useable though scratched up
 I like the amazon customer service as they replaced my order when I got the damaged one
 Le Creuset made a decent effort in making a cast iron Chinese-styled wok.

 I've stir fried in this pan quite a few meals, including carmelizing onions with soy sauce. When used with medium heat, cleaning is very easy. Soaking it for a few minutes and then scrubbing with scotch bright for a minute works. I've done this also with high heat, it needed more scrubbing but after a few minutes it looked new.

I cook for myself and thought 9" would suffice, but I didn't take into account the fact that I cook for 2-3 days at a time. This pan is a bit too small in that capacity.

 Regarding the "glue" issue.  The cutting board came to me as described in Lisa Dryer's review below:  shrink-wrapped in plastic.  However, the product's label was adhered to the surface of the cutting board with a big glob of what appears to be that clear sticky stuff they use to hold inserts in magazines, etc. .....and it adheres to bamboo, for sure.  I managed to get most of it off, but a thin layer remains.  I figure that "Goof-Off" or some other solvent would get rid of it, but I don't want to put poison on something that'll be holding my food.Regarding the "glue" issue.

I figure that "Goof-Off" or some other solvent would get rid of it, but I don't want to put poison on something that'll be holding my food.One solution is to use only one side of the cutting board.  One solution is to use only one side of the cutting board.  Otherwise, it appears to be a perfectly fine product
 We have been using these for several years now.  For refrigerator storage and reheating, we use these containers almost daily.  I remember the lids were a bit stiff at first, but not impossible unless you are over 80.We have been using these for several years now.

 So far I have made several different ice creams in my new machine.  This is the first I'd ever had and the hard part is making the different recipies and deciding what you like and what you don't.  The machine is very efficient.  You just put the mixture in and it does all the work.  You may want to check on your mixture a few times because some thicken earlier than others.  You just stop it and give a taste to see if you like the consistency.  I made one mistake of putting the mixture in before it was completely cooled and it didn't thicken and I wasted all of it, so be sure it is completely cool before you put it in the machine.  The machine is a little noisy but I expected that after reading about it, not as bad as I thought it would be though.  Overall, very happy
 It was the perfect price and the cheapest that i found anywhere and i would recomend it to anyone
 This color of Fiesta is just gorgeous and a great addition to any collection. My sister-in-law, for whom this was a gift, just loves it and I'd be tempted to buy a set for myself if I didn't already have a ton of dishes. The Fiesta line are all well made, solid dishes that can be used for all occasions.  If you know someone needing dishes, the Fiesta line is the way to go. These dishes increase in value regularly and add a lovely touch of color to your table
 I looked for somewhere to find these Corelle plates and found them on Amazon.  My favorite dish and plate design should last a while and withstand my abuse
 This plate, the 10 inch is the normal size dinner plate, just so you know. It's easy to buy the wrong size with these because they come in so many sizes. My aunt has had the Winter Frost White as long as I can remember, and now I am slowly building my own collection. I love them - they are very light and strong. I tried throwing a plate on the kitchen floor and it is still intact. The material feels like a combination of porcelin and pyrex as weird as that sounds. They are so thin and light that I could probably carry at least 35 of them. This is perfect for your everyday meals. Highly recommended
 The combination of the great price and incredible durability makes this stuff perfect for just about everyone.  Both I and my parents have been using Corelle dinnerware for over 15 years, and are amazed at how well they hold up
 Pretty good product.  We have not changed the batteries yet & it does get quite a bit of usage.  It's easy to use & not an eye-sore in my kitchen.  Very fast shipping!  I would order again
 I recently received this pan as a gift, and have been extremely impressed with it!  The "infused anodized" surface performs as advertised, providing a terrific hybrid between regular and non-stick cooking.  I love the 14" size -- it's great for those times when I used to have to split things up into more than one 10" saute pan, as well as for one-pan stovetop-to-oven dishes.I recently received this pan as a gift, and have been extremely impressed with it!

 This is one of my favorite knives - and I have quite a collection of them, believe me.  It's sturdy, sharpens easily, and seems to contour to my hand when chopping.  I'm a faster sous chef for myself and others with this knife.  Great price, I might add.  This brand across the board is one of my all-time favorites.  I've never been disappointed with a knife I purchased from Victorinox
 The Food processor has many many organized accessories that were sent with the purchase. I know I was buying a good brand but it was not just a good product it's an Excellent food processor and worth more than the money. My wife LOVES you know guys waht that means. Also it has a juice maker not mentioned in the add woooow. The seller was more than Excellent.
 This low cost loaf pan does everything you would expect a loaf pan to do. It's dark color absorbs enough heat to produce desired browning. It also releases cleanly. The protruding lips serve as handles (although if they were a little bigger they'd be easier to grip while wearing oven mitts). All in all, this is an excellent buy for a loaf pan - you should buy two since many recipes call for making two loaves

 These bags and all of the Foodsaver brand bags are flawless. The only way they would fail is if they are being used wrong. If you do Ebay you can get these same 32 count gallon bags for about $10.99 + $5.50 for shipping. And sometimes you can find a seller that will combine shipping for multiple boxes. I purchaced 3 boxes of gallon 32 cnt bags for $32.97 + $9.00 for shipping. Also keep in mind that you can wash and re-use these bags as long as they did not hold any kind of meat and that they have never been boiled. I have used them multiple times for things like corn on the cob
 Solidly built with easy to read numbers. Looks like it will last a long time  although it was a little pricey.
 I've only had this thermometer for about a week, but so far, it does exactly what it's supposed to -- stays in place at the back of the oven and displays the temperature using numbers large enough that I can read them easily without opening the oven door. Very satisfied
 OK so I got this set for free, but I would have paid something for it.  The little peeler works fine but the parer isn't the sharpest knife in my knife block.  I've attempted to sharpen it but it doesn't hold an edge well
 I suppose color choices would be nice; choice is almost always good.  But my smaller Golden loves it.  She likes the view it gives her and it's room and she doesn't paw at the sides.  My larger Golden (118 lbs - and no he's not fat; he's just a tall, tall Golden) would paw at the sides and that could spell disaster with this crate.  She thinks is very cool and I like the weight of it for being prepared to hit the road when the next hurricane is announced.  He has a big folding metal crate and that suits him
 What you see is what you get.  It works just fine, there isn't really much that could go wrong.  The only thing is I should have gotten the larger size.  What they call a cup and what I call a cup didn't really measure up.  For me it makes two regular mugs
 This teapot was a good buy all in all.  It's true about how the leaves container doesn't stay in a static position... this concerned me at first, but it hasn't been a problem.  The tea press will slide down over time without leaves in the pot, I put it in the leaves container on an angle and this stops that from happening.  I have never had a problem loosing heat to fast from this pot, contrary to previous reviews.  Yeah, some things could be better quality... but considering the price I'd call it a good buy
 I think you could do just about anything to this bottle opener and it would come out just fine. As noted by other reviewers, this opener has a wonderful substantial weight. It has Kitchenaid's signature quality and great color! Goes well with my other utencils and gadgets. Oh, it opens bottles very well too
      All the hype is true.  The sensations are sinful, but totally legal.  I'm still embarrassed that I spent that much money on a dessert maker, but I don't regret a penny of it.   When I clean the machine, I only wish I had a tongue long enough to lap up every drop.  I hide from the kids so I can lick the paddle blades alone.     "Normal" ice cream from this machine can send you into another realm, but Italian-style gellato will deliver you to a level of transcendence previously thought impossible here on earth.  Slowly heat four cups of fresh cream in a large pot to just below a simmer (surface will start to shimmer).  In a small pot, melt four ounces of best bittersweet chocolate on lowest heat.  In a large, deep bowl, beat four fresh egg yolks on high speed and gradually add 2/3 cups sugar.  Slowly pour the hot cream into the yolks and sugar.  Mix in 1/2 cup of ground chocolate (Ghiardelli, for example).  Add melted chocolate and return to large pot.  Heat mixture to about 160 degrees, stirring frequently, and cook until it thickens (about fifteen or twenty minutes).  Don't let it get above 165 degrees, or it might burn.  Remove from heat, cool, and place in refrigerator for at least an hour.  Pour into Musso, turn on machine, and prepare yourself.  Tell only your closest, dearest loved ones
 I've had this cookware since 1991. It has performed exactly as promised. Regardless of all the use (this is the hardest working piece in the set) It's in great shape. I use it for so many things, sauteing vegetables, a large omelette (to share). A 10" skillet is a must have and more than one is even better. Please never use aerosol cooking sprays. A "pumped" spray is recommended or just pour a little oil or a pat of butter for more flavor. Great even heat and total release, even when cheese is used. Fast easy hand wash
 So far our food processor has been great. We bought it to make our own baby food, and since then we have used it to make many other things as well. I'm very happy with it
 These scissors are ideal for the kitchen. The size is nice, good grips fit well in the hand. They are sharp and appear to be easy to sharpen for the future.I especially like that they come apart easily for cleaning... and go back together easily also.Highly recommend if you're looking for a good quality, all-purpose kitchen scissor
 These shears are indispensable. First they are sharp and stay that way---definitely not to be used by children. They will definitely bone a chicken all by themselves (but I spare mine a little by using poultry shears to cut heavier bone).Easy to handle. But best of all, they come apart and go back together with extreme ease, yet stay together for use. Contrary to the description, it is not necessary to use the cap and screw to get them apart. They are well designed with a slot and protrusion arrangement that allow them to be separated for CLEANING with a single motion and to be rejoined the same way. The cap and screw are only necessary for sharpening. You'll wonder how you ever got along without them
 I just love Fiestaware and this is the perfect chili bowl! It is a great size for chili or soup! The quality is fantastic adn the price was very good
 This item was ordered to replace a Kitchen Aid unit used extensively for a number of years.  I am a heavy gourmet baker and cater to very discriminating clients.

 If you like your Friday cocktail, and enjoy having people over to enjoy it with you, then get an ice bucket and some tongs. I purchased this one when my old one rusted out and like it much better. It's just classy enough, without seeming snooty, and holds a nice amount of ice. Just fill it, stick it on your bar or table, and then you don't have to worry about continually opening up the freezer
 i love this dutch oven.   don't even debate whether or not you should buy it .... just buy it.  you will not regret it.  i'm consistently amazed at how well food turns out after cooking in it.   after buying it i tend to use it in place of my all clad pieces.   amazing
 I absolutely LOVE this cookware.  Don't be put off by the seemingly high price.  You will hand this stuff down to your kids.  What's so special about it?  It out performs all of my other cookware (yes, even All-Clad) on the stovetop and in the oven.  The even heating is better than I could have imagined. It will even perform despite the crappiest cooktops.  And, as an added bonus, it's the easiest to clean.  I use mine for most everything . . . pot roast, soup, stew, pasta sauces, braising, slow-cooking, etc.  It's great
 This stockpot is the best of all the Visions offerings.  The worst being the skillet.This stockpot is the best of all the Visions offerings.  The worst being the skillet.It's great for popping corn too.   
 I find this timer very easy to use. I'm not a rocket scientist.I have never been disappointed with Kitchen Aid. I don't understand why it has gotten bad reviews. I think some people should stick with a sun dial
 I received this item last week and immediately tried it.  It was easy to use and worked quite fast.  Needed much less marinating juice to get the job done.  I wish it was also available in a bigger size for a larger group.
 Use it keep to store and keep food fresh as wel
 I only use the Brisk Brew for heating water while on vacation....I'm a tea drinker.  My Ex husband got custody of the first one we bought, so the search was on.  When I couldn't find it in the stores I went on line.  As soon as I saw the exact same I ordered it.  It works great, and travels light! 
 Having now owned this device for three months, I found it to be a very useful device to have around if you need hot water and there isn't any or no way to get any. Its lightweight, very portable and compact. While listed as a coffee maker, it brewed very slowly and not all that well. But as a hot water heater, it served fantastically well. The typical 8 oz water will heat through the system in about 4-5 minutes, so little patience is needed. The device seem to overheat a bit so cool down period would be wise between uses.Having now owned this device for three months, I found it to be a very useful device to have around if you need hot water and there isn't any or no way to get any.

It also come with a small spoon. Machine often come on by itself even before you hit the "on" button, probably if you hit the button before you plug it in. I would recommended that you have everything set up before hand.There's an automatic shut off, the machine come with two plastic containers that fit inside the water hold.

The following products could be considered as tailored made for this device: Lipton Cup a Soup (sheer perfect for this machine), General Food International coffee mixes and various kind of hot chocholate brands. It also great for tea bags as well. I am not sure about brewing tea though.I used this device at work quite a bit and found it to be super handy thanks to the small size.

 This baster is big enough to accomplish most tasks, and it even makes a great costume accessory on Halloween. Except that when I used it as part of my Halloween party costume along with a doctor's lab coat and stethoscope, all the women blushed and left the room. Oh well, maybe next time I'll come as a proctologist
 I have Le Creuset and Calphalon pots and pans but I find myself constantly reaching for this Farberware pot.  The design is why I bought it.  I would have been willing to pay $100 for one just like it from Calphalon or Le Creuset but this is the only one of its kind I could find anywhere online.It doesn't have the weight of my other pots but the sheer practicality of being able to strain your food without worries of burning yourself (the spouts are great) or using another dish far outweights any reservations on possible durability.It doesn't have the weight of my other pots but the sheer practicality of being able to strain your food without worries of burning yourself (the spouts are great) or using another dish far outweights any reservations on possible durability.Kudos to Farberware for coming up with such an ingenious and sensible design.  It makes one wonder if the other brands out there ever listen to their customers
 I bought this as a birthday gift to myself and I love it.  I thought I would miss being able to preset my coffee timer at night to wake up to coffee, but this makes it so quickly that has not been a factor.  The taste is unbeatable!  Even if you leave the warmer on the entire morning the coffee never tastes bitter.  Highly Recommended for coffee lovers!
 This is an outstanding device. in several I've had before the cutter blades were not fastened to the center piece. They would flex as the coring progressed and the slices would be rendered a mess. This corer has rigidly attached blades and therefore cuts clean, perfect slices every time
 This casserole dish has some minor inconveniences.  It's made of some sort of pottery so it cools down very slowly and it's easy to let something sit for 15 minutes and come back and burn your hand.  I also learned through this dish that square casserole dishes are easier to cut brownies out of than round or oval ones.  It does however cook things just fine and is not too large for what I need it for
 Le Creuset baking dishes are an investment in good cooking for a lifetime. This 11 1/2-Inch size oval dish is similar in size and shape to a medium-sized au gratin. It is large enough to bake two large fish fillets or four boneless chicken breasts or a casserole. Many times, I double a casserole recipe and put half in this dish and then freeze it for later use. I bring the dish right from the oven to the table for serving, and I find its clean-up is easy afterward
 The only complaint from the other reviews that I can agree with is that the amount of froth on the milk is hard to control.  I certainly don't have any trouble getting hot milk.  My taste in coffee is probably not very sophisticated, but this machine produces espresso and latte as good as I've had in America.The only complaint from the other reviews that I can agree with is that the amount of froth on the milk is hard to control.

It does a good job of controlling the temperature of the frothed milk, but no matter what I do, I almost always end up with around 1/2 inch of froth on my latte.

The coffee never comes out evenly, and if you use pods you can only make a single shot at a time anyway.  The end result of the two holes is that whenever I make an espresso, some of it dribbles down the side of the cup instead of going in.  It's also a bit short for any latte glass I've ever found, and you have to tilt the glass to get it under.The bit where the coffee comes out into your cup (you can see my level of sophistication there) has two holes, so it can pour into two cups at once.

There are a couple of things I'd like to change (milk froth control and height of coffee dispenser), but I would still recommend it
 When my Braun FlavorSelect coffee maker unexpectedly stopped working, I had to scramble to find a new machine. I wanted another Braun, but unfortunately, they seem to have stopped making a 12 cup coffee maker. So I had to begin an intense search for a machine that had the features I wanted combined with good value. I finally found it with this Cuisinart model.When my Braun FlavorSelect coffee maker unexpectedly stopped working, I had to scramble to find a new machine.

So I had to begin an intense search for a machine that had the features I wanted combined with good value. I finally found it with this Cuisinart model.The advantages? For one, it makes excellent and HOT coffee. The carafe is solidly constructed and fits securely in square body so there's no chance of someone accidentally knocking it loose. Because the lid fits tightly, the pour is precisely narrow and smooth, with no side leaks even when the pot is full. The basket fits inside the housing instead of swinging free like so many models which prevents a misalignment between the water and the filter; the conical (Krups/Braun style) basket accepts both paper filters and gold-tone, although I learned the hard way that not all gold filters fit. The timer is very easy to program, as is the clock. The carafe warmer can be set at low, medium, or high for the temperature that's right for you. I found the "high" setting too hot since I drink my coffee black (I like my coffee hot but not scalding!), but those who add a lot of milk might appreciate it. The brewing is quick and efficient, with the process taking about a minute a cup, maybe less. The retro/stainless look complements most modern kitchen dcors. There's a 1-4 cup setting to make sure such small amounts stay hot, and you can select how long the warmer remains on. The pot beeps five times when brewing is complete and just before the warming plate shuts off. Parts are top rack dishwasher safe. It comes with a water filter system designed to improve the taste of the brew.The advantages? For one, it makes excellent and HOT coffee.

The water reservoir is located on the right side, in the back, which makes it a little challenging for lefties like me to dump the final bit of water inside even though the carafe pours very accurately. Although I haven't yet missed the opening, I do struggle briefly with those last few drops unless I use my right hand. The housing is fairly tall, so if your counter space is only under the cabinets, you may not be able to lift the top in its entirety. (This is when the small rear reservoir becomes a major issue as you have to have room to completely lift the rather large top toward the back.) Clearance required: 7.5" wide by 8.5" deep of counter space with no overhead obstruction to pull out for filling OR 21.5" of overhead space to fully lift top. Without the top open, the coffee maker measures 7.5"w x 8.5"d x 14.25"h.But the Cuisinart does have disadvantages.

(This is when the small rear reservoir becomes a major issue as you have to have room to completely lift the rather large top toward the back.) Clearance required: 7.5" wide by 8.5" deep of counter space with no overhead obstruction to pull out for filling OR 21.5" of overhead space to fully lift top. Without the top open, the coffee maker measures 7.5"w x 8.5"d x 14.25"h.If you have the space for this coffee maker, you'll love it. I can't attest to how long it will last, but, as it comes with a three year warranty, I'm hoping for a good run
 This pan heats up evenly, no hot or cool spots, and the handles stay cool.  It's great for cooking bacon or scrambling eggs.  Cuisinart recommends not turning the heat up to High, and so far, it hasn't been necessary.  Very good value. 
 I have been using a Cuisinart 9" skillet for a few years now and love it - one of the best pans I've ever owned (and I've owned a few -top names too). but when my 13" stainless steel skillet (from another name) warped under too much heat (it couldn't take the heat from my Viking Range), I immediately started a search for a Cusinart replacement. I couldn't believe the price. Fortunately I have the lid from the previous pan because the cusinart doesn't come with one
 Works very well.  Only drawback it's large - but stands upright.Well worth the money and quit in the low speed.
 The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere.

 I have enjoyed my new KitchenAid.  I'm thinking that I may have liked the smaller model that has the beater that tips up instead of having the bowl lifter, as it is awkward sometimes working around the beater.  Overall, I am happy and can mix a lot in a short amount of time
 The cirtus juicer works great (like all Kitchen Aid products) but it's pricy by the time you pay $8 to ship it. However my local outlet mall wanted over $30 for it plus tax..
 I received these as a Christmas gift and am very pleased with them.  They are very thin so it makes gripping things out of the oven a lot easier than with thick mitts - AND they'll take up less room in your drawer.  Highly recommend - worth the extra money
 This was purchased as a wedding present.  I do not yet know what the couple thinks of it but it is the one they requested
 You know, for this price, you could throw anything away.  But, this 'synthetic' comforter is so soft, silky and light, I can toss it on and not feel weighted down.  I also have a cat and with cat hairs I can vacumn them off easily (down is more difficult), but just having the airy warmth is worth it. 
 I've used this set for several years now  and have been very pleased with the overall cutting ability of these knives. Even though I also own Global and Shun kitchen knives, I find myself being drawn to the Insignia knives when I am in a hurry or in the middle of a large project. Although both the Global and the Shun have sharper edges, their price difference doesn't equate directly to the increased level of sharpness that you get. That is to say, yes Global and Shun knives are sharper, but they are not three to four hundred percent sharper all though their price difference certainly would suggest that.

Using my Insignia knives, I am able to quickly dice, cut, and slice through onions, carrots, chicken, roasts, etc. That said, there are several cavets that need to be stated. First, don't wash these knives in a dishwasher. It has nothing to do with the quality of the steel. I wouldn't wash my Ken Onion Shun Chef's knife in the dishwasher and that one knife costs as much as two whole sets of the Insignia. Second, these knives need to be honed regularly. A few strokes after every use makes a real difference. Third, after owning the knives for almost two years, I sharpened each of the knives on oil stones. These knives, like all knives will need to be resharpened from time to time. The good news is that they resharpened quite nicely, a tribute to their quality. Since resharpening, they have continued to hold their edges.

All though I am a bit of a knife snob, and although I would love to purchase a block set of either the Shun or the Globals, I can't justify it given that the Insignia's cut so well. My wife would really give me no end of grief if I threw out a perfectly good set of knives. And a good set of knives these are

 A long time Krups customer, I purchased this blender after 10 years of suffering with a lack luster, non Krups blender, which was given to me as a wedding present. To say this is an outstanding blender would be an understatement. I'm amazed with how quiet the blender is and the best feature is how powerful it is. We use our blender for smoothies in the morning and my husband uses it for his nutrition drinks in the evenings, so we needed something that was durable, substantial and will last a long a time.A long time Krups customer, I purchased this blender after 10 years of suffering with a lack luster, non Krups blender, which was given to me as a wedding present.

 This is the best cooling rack I have ever seen.  I have used it primarily for cookies, but it works great for other baked goods as well.  Because of the small grid, nothing gets bent or broken.  The size is perfect for putting many cookies on to cool without trying to squeeze them together. Clean up is a breeze.  Just add a couple of recipes and this would make a very nice gift.  I know I wouldn't want to be without it
 I love this vacuum!  It is great for doing quick jobs around the house, vacuuming the stairs and vacuuming up the lint in the laundry room.  I would highly recommend this little vacuum to anyone.  I love that you can use it like a dustbuster to clean to car or use the long arm to do regular cleaning
 I purchased this knife because my daughter didn't like using any of my knives; she wanted one like the chefs all use on Food Network.  I wasn't willing to pay the high prices of the professional ones so this was a good compromise, and I'm pleased with it.  It's nice-looking, feels comfortable to hold, works well for chopping vegetables. Overall, a decent knife at a very reasonable price. 
 This is truely a professional grater.  Does a great job with hard cheeses and chocolate, etc..  Looks and feels great in the hand, and is impressive to have on the table for your dinner guests to grate their own Parmesan
 I love these pans. I got the set for a wedding gift last year but needed another saucepan, so this was perfect. This one is a little larger than the 2 pans in the set. I absolutely love the set - the pans heat up very quickly and clean up beautifully. They're less expensive than many of the gourmet sets but just as good
 I purchased this product for two reasons: I own other Cuisinart cookware and like it very much...secondly, I frequently make spaghetti sauce with meatballs and find that a 3-quart saucepan just isn't large enough. The 4-quart size is perfect. For some reason I can't explain, my sauce tastes much better made in this saucepan
 I'm really glad to have replaced my non-stick with the Cuisinart pans. I have been increasingly concerned about the safety of non-stick. I was really scared that they would stick and I would have to scrub them, but they've been really good so far. I'm not crazy about the hazy look that the bottoms get inside, but I know it's because I cook on med-high heat and I need to get some Barkeeper's friend. Overall, really pleased with this purchase, and I'm still adding to my set
 This is my third Salad Shooter in the past 20 or so years.  Wouldn't be without one!  It's great
 I carefully read most of the reviews for this product before purchasing so I would know what to expect.  They mostly said the same thing:  either it broke or it worked perfectly.  The consensus seemed to say use only hard cheeses, and don't overcrank the handle.  We have only used it for parmesan cheese, and so far we've had no problems.  It works great so far
 Right out of the box and with skim milk, I have a latte that rivals the corner coffee bar.  Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to clean.  Can I ask for more?  What else is there
 I am replacing the same product that I have used continually for the past nine years or so. It has been an indispensable part of our kitchen all those years and we hope this new one will continue the tradition

 I have used mine for over a year now. I will never buy anything except this line of cookware in the future. Never sticks, easy to clean, after a year of everyday use (family of 6) it's still in good shape! Note: We only clean it with a dobie pad as directed! Large enough to do four american-toast at the same time. Great heat distribution. Just great, and BIG! Gave it to some friends as a present, they love it too. Glad I found it in this lifetime! Get it - I think You'll love it too! And No, I have no affiliation with calaphon
 This combo is awesome!  I've used coconut oil (very little--it doesn't burn or smoke when heated) to season it and the press gets better with each use.  I use olive oil for the meat or bread I'm cooking and, although a steak wasn't seared as much as I would have liked, the pannini are outstanding.  The coconut oil seems to season without coloring so much and this is the first time in a very long life that I've correctly seasoned a pan.  Residue now just slips off with hot water and a natural bristled brush.  Please read the use and care instructions--I don't usually but for some reason sat down and did--you will find them very informative.  I love it
 When I bought this thing 3 years ago I thought I might do kabobs on it but not only does it cook kabobs beautifully it also cooks tandoori chicken and tandoori bread!When I bought this thing 3 years ago I thought I might do kabobs on it but not only does it cook kabobs beautifully it also cooks tandoori chicken and tandoori bread!I can't have an open flame grill where I live, and when I bought this I used it in the apartment.  Now I take it on my patio to grill.  I like the see-through lid which most of these grills don't have.  It's too bad they've discontinued this produc
 Like the other reviewers, I have a cat who previously showed little to no interest in cat items - until I put this out.  It's now his regular spot to nap, and lounge. 
 I love my Vienna Deluxe!  We've been using it for 4-8 coffees per day for 7 months now and have certainly saved money over going to the coffee shop.  If you plan to buy more than 100 coffees (for us about 3 months worth) it already pays for itself and the coffee tastes better.  The flavor of the coffee is awesome and it's super easy to make.

The only bad thing I can say about this coffee machine is that the 'key' in the back of it got a little bit off and we had to manually turn it so that the brew unit would fit back in.  It only took us about 2 hours to figure out and fix it, so it wasn't that big of a deal.

 This pan is very easy to clean.  However, the small base won't sit stably on my gas range.  I keep a hand on the handle and pay attention to how it sits on the range to overcome the problem
 I hav K5SS model of the Kitchen Aid Mixer and it has worked well for me when I do my cookies, cakes or mix ground meat for meat loaf. It is very easy and convenient to use. Basically, I would want to inquire about other attachments for this model and how and where can I get them. I am from the Philippines. I am interested to purchase attachements like a sausage stuffer, grinder. Sorry for using this site, as I am lost where to get in touch with "Kitchen Aid Inc". thanks and please email me
 I don't think these are the highest quality sheet you will ever find as it has some thread coming out of the hem after a couple washes.  With that said, for the price, the sheets are very nice and feel soft after a couple washes. 
 I can't begin to describe how worthwhile a piece of equipment this is.  It makes the best little potato shreds for potato pancakes, then, you just switch blades and slice up a little onion for them in the same bowl, which you can then mix the batter in.  The bowl component is my number 1 favorite feature of this little guy, but it just plain works really well
 These pans are mahvelous, dahling.  Having said that, I've read lots of reviews that included complaints about the strength of the adhesive used to stick the labels on the pans.  To one, to all:  There is a product called "GOO GONE" that is designed for just this type of thing.  You can find it almost anywhere, hardware stores, grocery stores, etc.  It works in minutes, and leaves no trace of the adhesive behind.  Just be sure the wash the pan afterwards.  Happy adhesive-free baking
 These bags are durable and work everytime.  I like the size which seems hard to find locally
 I like this a lot.  It is very compact and easy to use. I like the built in ice strainer. You just slip off the cap and pour. No hassles of the top jamming and having to beat it open with a knife. You will need a finer strainer if you want to filter out citrus pulp, for example. But for most cocktails you are just straining out the ice. But I like this one for it's convenience
 This machine is really a great invention - especially for those of us who have a tendency to spend on good tea and then screw up some part of the process that falls between the brewing and the first sip (for example, infusing the tea for too long).  I think my tea will have more of a fighting chance with this new machine.  The design is great - quite classy, and I think it will be great for entertaining (loved the way the tray that holds the machine could suddenly be converted into a serving tray for the well-designed tea pot and cups).  Here is how it worked for me: You pour your loose tea in the infuser basket, fill the tank with water, select the strength of your beverage and turn it on.  There's even a chance to choose which kind of tea you are brewing for optimal results (for example oolong or green).  This nifty little machine will do the rest.  It will even pour the tea in the tea pot!  I'm finally enjoying my fine tea without the stress.  It's almost like having a tea butler in my house!
 The KitchenAid line of silicone utensils are positively perfect.  They are very will made and excellent quality.  The silicone material is amazing, it is so easy to clean, whether you are using this mixing spatula with cake mix, cookie dough or anything you are mixing or scraping nothing will sticks to it.  The curved design on this spatula is a perfect match to the KitchenAid stand mixer bowl and it also works very well with my All Clad mixing bowls.  With this spatula you will not miss a drop of anything in the bowl.  Highly recommended
 This tea pot, like their French-Press coffee pot, is made of `magic glass' - it doesn't seem to break.  I'm hard on things and usually need heavy-duty models just for every day survival.  I've had this tea pot for - maybe 8 years - unheard of for things around me. The glass just doesn't seem to break.  Others have spoken about how you use it to make tea - a brilliant idea.  But here's the other cool thing: when you get a `presentation' tea like say a `peony' tea that opens into a flower or say, a sea-shell tea like peets.com sells that opens up into an oyster looking shell with a string of jasmine flowers as `pearls' floating above it - you can SEE the magic unfold and enjoy the beauty and art of the tea unfolding if you leave the infuser out and just let the folded tea do what ever it does.This tea pot, like their French-Press coffee pot, is made of `magic glass' - it doesn't seem to break.

But I have never found that to be a problem.  The tea MAY cool a bit faster - but not so much so that it bothers me.  The fact that it is glass and has outlasted so many hand thrown ceramic tea pots I've had speaks to it's wonder and durability.  Like I said, this is made of magic glass.
 I have purchased many different brands of measuring spoons and cups in the past but these are by far the best!  Heavy (but not too heavy to use) so the handles don't bend (or float around in the dishwasher), shaped well so they fit into containers and spice bottles easily, easy to level and the measurement markings will not fade away (they are engraved).  I love my set...will definately buy another set (cooking is my hobby)
 Fantastic, works perfectly, easy to clean, much more sanitary than a n old fashioned bristle brush.  Also gentler on the pastries or breads
 Boy, do I LOVE this piece! I got mine for a LOT less at an outlet store and it's just wonderful. I LOVE the purple color - it's just gorgeous in a tuscan kitchen and this piece looks marvelous on the table. It does wonderfully in the oven - it's not overly big so don't get it to feed a family of 5 or so.  It's about 1.5 quarts.  I get tons of compliments on these pieces and the purple, well, it's just original and if you're afraid of it, don't be. It's just a gorgeous color and one that I'm very glad to have introduced into my kitchen. I'm getting more! Highly recommended piece.
 This is the best spatula I have ever owned, and I have owned entirely too many. It is strong and wide and slightly curved at the front edge to fit my pans. The front edge is also nice and thin so it slides right under any food. And it cleans up like magic-no holes for junk to get stuck in. And you can rest it right on the skillet without it melting or lay it on the counter because the handle is curved in such a manner as to keep the head from resting on the countertop. Seriously-the best spatula ever
 This tool makes even the toughest jar a breeze to open, accommodating a range of sizes easily. I'm sending one to everyone in my family this Christmas
 Finding the right items to start the perfect kitchen for two is so easy thanks to OXO.  I love their good grips products.  All the handles look great, but are also very comfortable and practical.  This strainer fits in well to a kitchen for feeding 2 or 3 people.  You can use this double rod strainer not only for straining, but also for sifting flour, draining, and if need be - awkwardly steaming veggies over boiling water.Finding the right items to start the perfect kitchen for two is so easy thanks to OXO.

You have to make few enough in each batch that they can all rise to the top at once.  Then you scoop them all up with the strainer (the bigger strainer may be hard to fit in many pots).  Drain the gnocchi and place on a paper towel.  Since you can do all this with one hand, you can use your other hand to grab more gnocchi to start a-boilin' quick as can be.It seems most people might go for the 8" instead, but this one works perfectly for making gnocchi from scratch.

Maybe if item is dropped immediately after removing from the freezer??????  But, under normal conditions, I've had no problems.  Crystal clear, easy to clean, stacks just fine.  Don't regret my purchase and as stated, will be getting additional sets. 
 I immediately noticed the quality of this wok as soon as I took it out of the box. Very nice looking. Very easy to cook in. It's big and has large sides so it is very easy to stir the stir fry around without spilling it. The non stick surface works beautifully. Reattaching the wok to the base after cleaning is fairly easy although the wok never seems to lock 100% correctly into place without a little hassle. I'm not sure it really matters if it's not perfectly 100% aligned into the base anyway. Nevertheless, that's only a minor gripe. This wok makes stir fry easy and fun and makes the food taste really good. The included spatula was a nice gesture, too. The instructions say the wok can do a lot of other things too, like slow cooking, but I only use it for stir fry
 These glasses DO work and in much more distinct way that I could have ever imagined. I have bought many Riedel glasses to my wine-lover friends and they absolutely love it too. You got to try them to believe it. You won't regret it 
 This pot is a perfect medium-sized saucepan. The double handles are a great feature. We use it at least once a day in our kitchen. The non-stick surface is extremely durable, although I'm not sure I would use metal utensils with it. I use a blue scrub sponge to clean it. I'm not sure I would use the more abrasive, green 3M pads. Overall a very durable, high-quality cooking utensil. In fact I'm back here today to buy one for a friend
 I love having these Pyrex cups in varying sizes.  The large ones are great for mixing and pouring batter, like pancakes.  The smaller one let's you measure once, to get 1 1/2 or 2 cups of liquid
 Ok, it's June and you are being hit up for present after present and you are on limited funds. No need to feel depressed. You can give this measuring cup set and hold your head up, knowing you gave something that won't be sneered at or find its way to the return pile by the blushing bride.Ok, it's June and you are being hit up for present after present and you are on limited funds.

I also use the glass cups for mixing batters to pour out right from the pitcher, and I use them for prepping foods like stir fry when you have to have a bunch of ingredients ready to hand to dump at once into the wok.

I also use the glass cups for mixing batters to pour out right from the pitcher, and I use them for prepping foods like stir fry when you have to have a bunch of ingredients ready to hand to dump at once into the wok. 
 Best iron I ever owned.  I read the reviews before purchasing and was not disappointed.  No one likes to iron, but this one makes it a little easier
 Very sturdy construction and I like the glass lid. The only problem I have is the lid has a VERY thin metal that is easily damaged. The pot is thick and the handles are riveted on and very solid. As long as you are careful with the lid, this steamer is awesome
 I had traditionally used pyrex cake pans and wasn't completely satisfied with the results. Just recently, I purchased the AirBake cake pan after having successful results in their line of cookie sheets. I am completely satisfied with this pan and recommend getting rid of the traditional pyrex
 I love this shelf. I have two. You just take it out of the box and the shelves fall into place. No screwdrivers, nothing to assemble. Its fabulous.
 I purchased the Mix It In on 9/8/06 and used it the next day.  I never got soft serve.  I froze the bowl again, this time in my upright freezer, and made the mix the day before and refrigerated it for 15 hours.  I purchased the Mix It In on 9/8/06 and used it the next day.  I never got soft serve.  I froze the bowl again, this time in my upright freezer, and made the mix the day before and refrigerated it for 15 hours.  Today, I made soft serve!!!!!!  It isn't perfect but I'm well on my way.  I have been making the low fat version but I think the regualar version will be excellent. To make this machine work for you here are some pointers:1.  If you don't have an upright or chest freezer, put the bowl in the back of your regular freezer.  2.  Freeze the bowl for as long as possible beyond the suggested 12 hours.  3.  You can forget the 12-15 minute check described in the manual.  You will not have a chance of having soft serv before a minimum of 25 minutes.  I mixed as long as 40 minutes.  4.  SAVE YOUR RECEIPT.  Since the ice cream takes twice as long to mix as is suggested in the manual, you are using the motor 2x as much.  Therefore, you might have to use the 3 year warranty.
 We've had this toaster for over a year and my family loves it. It toasts consistently. It accommodates all widths. And the digital selector is great
 I thought this set was cute in the picture, but was so excited when it actually came! It is truly a beautiful set. I have run them through the dishwasher a number of times already and they come out looking like new, and my husband loves the "larger than normal" size. I have little hands & I really like them too -they are very sturdy. The biggest bonus, other than the 8 settings plus the 5 piece serving set, is the extra 8 teaspoons!
 You can depend upon pyrex to give you a great product. Use this cup for measuring all the time
 I love this carafe---no drips like others I have used! The best part was how fast I recieved it----AMAZON was so efficient----I ordered it and before I knew it---it was here!!
 The main problem with my bed was the featers were pocking me while I was sleeping no matter what I put on the top of the feather bed. Not anymore after I bought this magic cover.Now I can enjoy my new bed without paying the price of being tortured all night by the small needle like feathers :)
 Although small, these little cups come in really handy.  Have small amounts of liquid to measure before you measure those tablespoons of sugar or flour?  Now you don't need to be concerned, just use a little OXO cup and move on!  I use them every time I bake and leave the measuring spoons dry or completely alone.  Just love them and need another set
 Henkel Pro S knives are second to none.  They will last a lifetime and make a tremendous difference in your cooking.  These knives take the 'chore' out of cutting vegis
 the 8" chef's knife is a little heavy, but other than that, they both work great so far...especially for the price. i've used them daily for a month, and they have not lost their sharpness at all.

But 20 years of great service from my previous set of Henckels certainly warranted a loyal update/upgrade to another Henckels set.The set of Henckels that I've owned since the mid-80s finally gave in to a lot of use, sharpenings and dishwashings (dishwashing a good knife is a nice way to shorten the handle's life expectancy!).

In my opinion, it's better than a carving knife.- a sharpening steel- kitchen shears - and a storage block with 11 slots which is great because some of the knives, especially the serrated knives, from my old set are still in mint shape (like the 8" bread knife), so there's plenty of room in the block for knives in your current collection looking for a new place to sleep.- and a storage block with 11 slots which is great because some of the knives, especially the serrated knives, from my old set are still in mint shape (like the 8" bread knife), so there's plenty of room in the block for knives in your current collection looking for a new place to sleep.No 8" carving knife.

 A very solid knife set, especially with the extra slots for those who have a few "favorite" knifes left in the drawer.  MAKE SURE when you buy Henckels to get the "twin" set instead of the single little henckel-man, that's a big upgrade in quality.  Oh, and for goodness sake people, quit putting your knife set through the dishwasher and just clean them as you go
 Wonderful pan, but the handles get VERY warm since it is oven-proof  -  wish it was broiler proof
 I did not realise how much I needed a new one till I got the new one
 Great product. I am using this because my kitchen is under remodelling. Works great with smaller vessels. Heats up evenly. I give 4 points because I am annoyed by the bulb on the stove. It is ON as long as the burner is connected to power. I would rather have a burner which has bulb to show if the burner is ON/OFF.
 The French-made Roul'pat, like its cousin the Silpat, is a flexible silicon mat enclosing a thin, fiberglass mesh for durability. The Roul'pat is designed for creating a non-skid work surface for rolling out and kneading dough. The tacky surface adheres to the counter without clinging to the dough, making it easier to roll out thin pastry crusts and the like. Because the mat is flexible, the transfer of a pie crust to pan is a cinch. Dipped chocolates don't stick, nor does fondant. At sixteen and a half inches by twenty-four, the surface is expansive enough for most recipes. The only drawback to this unusual mat is the inability to cut on it, ruling out anything that requires a cookie cutter or knife. The manufacturer also warns against folding and scraping the surface.The French-made Roul'pat, like its cousin the Silpat, is a flexible silicon mat enclosing a thin, fiberglass mesh for durability.

Clean up is simple - wipe with a damp sponge and rinse. Mild soap can be used if needed, although I try to keep the surface detergent free.

 I've owned this grill pan for almost 2 years now and it does a great job of grilling everything from burgers to chicken, fish and thick steaks. It has the ability to heat up to a very high temperature, enabling me to nicely sear the outside of the meat. I can then pop the whole pan in the oven to finish cooking the inside of thick steaks or just to keep warm. As for clean up, the pan does need to sit and soak for a little while but after that, everything comes off with relative ease. No hard scrubbing involved. Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it
 I purchashed the Professional Series Tortilla Baker PS75791 to add healthy tortillas to my diet. I grind my own wheat berries and grow my oun yeast to make bread that is as fresh as it can be and is completed in 4 hours after grinding. A loaf cost just about 15 cents. I wanted to make freshly ground wheat tortillas for the cost savings and for the superior nutrition. I am very pleased with the results. I grind my wheat, but leave out the oil because I submurge my doe in olive oil so it will keep fresh for days in my frig and then work the oil into the doe just before pressing and cooking. The machine really works, and its easy to use. It a quality machine and is a mainstay of my healthy kitchen
 This sturdy little fan has been working well for months.  One quibble: its two speeds are medium & fast.  There is no "slow."  Overall, I'm a happy customer
 Unit works great, heats up fast, easy to clean, and much better built than the typical discount store models. It looks like this willlast a long time
 I have used a Revere teakettle for 41 years. To clean it...all you need to do is take some Easy Off oven cleaner (spray type) and spray the stainless steel part. This cleans all the grease spatters and any other spatters you get on it. Leave the Easy Off on until you see that you can wipe off the stains. Wipe, rinse and dry. It will look brand new
 I love the function of these glasses.  We were given some of these Bodum double wall glasses and immediately saw the quality difference.  They will not sweat, they will keep your cold stuff cold, etc.  I have two down-sides...  These must be handled gently, they are not that thick or hearty.  Until we realized what was going on, we cracked two by having our refigerator ice dispensor throw cubes into them, cracking them.  Plus I yanked the dishwasher open fast, knocking one over into something solid, and it broke.  I love the function of these glasses.

 While these are described as "beer" glasses, they are fantastic for keeping milk cold through a meal.  I actually pour the milk and place the glasses in the freezer while I start dinner.  These glasses are easy to clean and retain their "sunny" shine, even though we have very hard water.  NO SPOTS!  Great product
 When you bake with the Bavaria pan, you can be sure that the finished product is consistent in shape everytime. The pan bakes evenly and there is a crispness of form when the cake is unmolded
 I hope I never have to use it, but I have peace of mind, knowing it is in place
 This is a light weight box fan that is very easy to move from place to place. The remote feature is very convenient and it really helps keep the apartment cool
 This tablemate is perfect for anybody.It has many uses around the house which i could list but it would take to long. It is sturdy enough to hold about 20 to 30 lbs.when the tray is at its level position. The 3 positions is a plus because it gives you more options.The one thing that is a negative is the legs do not fold down completely for storage but everything else folds down(table top and the small bar.other than the legs not folding this is a five star
 I knew what I was buying, so there weren't any surprises. The only thing I do not like about them is the shallowness; I wanted that feature for storage, but I didn't take into account how easy it is to be messy when mixing. I would suggest having another bowl around for use with an electric mixer. I like them, and I would buy them again..
 I just ADORE silicone bakeware!!!I just ADORE silicone bakeware!!!I don't own this particular pan, but I'm replying to the first review. This pan, according to the description, measures 17-4/5 by 7 & 4/5 by 2 inches. I'd imagine that the individual loaves would probably measure approximately 8 by 3 & 1/2 inches, a good size for, for instance, zucchini bread loaves intended as Christmas gifts
 This pan works SO great! I have used it for cookies, biscuits, and pizza. Nothing has burned or stuck. SUPER EASY to clean, you can wipe it off with a paper towel and stick it in the dishwasher or just rinse it with a sponge and soap and everything just slips right off. GREAT PRODUCT!
 This product has been great.  The price is about half similar sized crates you can find at a pet store.  The only difference is the metal is a little thinner but if your dog is not aggressive, it should be fine.  Also, their is only one side door, doesn't have the 2 door options that higher priced crates have, BUT that didn't matter in our case.  This door was actually larger and our puppy found it easier to go in and out.  For the price, it's a great product
 I bought it for my Fiance and she loves it.  It's great for frying chicken
 Purchased the toaster as a gift for my daughter's family. They LOVE it. With 2 kids and friends, the large capacity, sleek design, and perfect toasted bagels, keeps everyone happy. Get lots of positive comments from friends on how it looks and toasts!
 I got a Sunbeam Hot Shot about 6 years ago.  It had been recommended by someone at work.  I used it at work every day (and still do) -- and have since bought another for home. It makes 2 cups of hot water -- and is great for everything  including tea, instant oatmeal and hot chocolate.  When my daughter was younger, it was great for her because she could make her own hot chocolate or instant macaroni and cheese, and I wouldn't have to worry about her being burned on the hot stove. With the hot shot, you just pour your water in the top and hit the "heat" button.  The machine will then shut itself off when the water is hot and you can dispense the water.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants fast, convenient,  and safe heating for hot water
 We have had braun coffee pots for several years and have been happy with the coffee maker. Unfortunately, the two coffee makers that we had ordered from Amazon had a persistent leaking problem unlike the exact same models that we have had in the past
 This thermometer has been a great asset to me during the course of my employment at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, as well as during my time as a student at Le Cordon Bleu. Easy to use, full-featured and very dependable, I  have recommended this thermometer to many people and use it many times each day
 First thing we cooked in this pan were burgers, and we could not believe the difference in taste compared to pan fried.  The raised ridges really carmelize the meat, and even when cooked well done the burgers are juicy.  We have prepared chicken, pork chops and fish, and they are all at least as good as charcoal grilled.  I would give this pan 10 stars if I could
 I got this to use with the Glorious ONE POT MEALS cookbook.  It has wonderful recipies, and the pot works wonderful.  Cleans up really easy.  Try it, you'll love it.Sharon From Colorad
 Purchased these to go with a 7 inch Henckels International santoku that I've been using for years, and the phrase that comes to mind to describe all Fine Edge cutlery is "good enough."  No, it isn't restaurant quality, and yes, if you put these through the dishwasher they'll tarnish and probably even start to rust (any metal designated as "stainless" is rust resistant rather than rust proof, and reviewers of other Henckels products complaining about rust and tarnish probably aren't treating their knives very well).  As a graduate student on a budget who enjoys cooking, but doesn't always have the time for it, these knives are an ideal compromise between price and quality.  Be aware that they will occasionally require sharpening - I've had the santoku for almost three years and run it through a commercially available ceramic disk sharpener every few months and it still cuts very nicely - and should probably be hand-washed for longest life.  With that little bit of maintenance, however, this three piece set can meet nearly all of your cooking needs (it meets all of mine, but then I don't often dress poultry, filet my own fish, or do much that would require a cleaver or really subtle boning knife) for quite a nice price
 After reading all the reviews and hearing about this on the radio, I went ahead and shelled out $100 for this.  I had really high expectation, having never spent so much for a heater before.  I have happy to say that I am completely satisfied.  This heater doesn't overwhelm and dry out the room with too much heat.  Instead it circulates the heat over time (you should probably give it a good half hour to properly heat the whole room) evenly heating the whole room and leaving absolutely no cold spots.  After spending some time in my room, I had completely forgotten how cold it was outside.  Other bonuses are that it is very easy to operate and has a thermostat so you can set it to the exact termerature that you want your room to be.  My only minor complaint is that for its price, it should have included a remote control.  Otherwise, it is a wonderful heater
 You put cake mix in it and make cake. This pan does just that. Yay
 The litter box is good if you have a cat that does not scratch.  My cat sometimes tears up the box with her claws so I have to keep an eye on her and the box for leaking and holes.  Other then that the chystals are excellent for odor
 I have to say that I have tried almost all of the self-cleaning litter boxes out there for my Large Male 14year old cat.  He has the electric water fountain for kitties and yes he does drink lot and lots of water, so you know what that means, yes, he pees a lot.  Oh yea he is a larger (not fat) kitty so he eats a lot also, I aint sayin no more on that subject.I have to say that I have tried almost all of the self-cleaning litter boxes out there for my Large Male 14year old cat.

Now my cat, with a regular clumping litter box had clumps the size of softballs.  After 25 days, there is, on the bottom of the inside tray, (not the bottom one that actually touches the floor and acts as the cover when you throw the thing out) a wet spot in the area that my cat likes to urinate at, apparently this is his favorite spot to pee.  On the bottom cardboard tray (the one that touches the floor and acts as the cover when you throw the cartridge out) there is just the hint of a wet spot.  I think that if they increase the wax content in the cardboard or if that is what is actually coating the cardboard this will help.The other gripe, but not major problem I have seen so far, is with the cardboard for the cartridge that the litter sits in.

 I bought this product back in July 2005 and have been using it to make my morning protein shakes.  It does a good job of it.  I cannot comment on its ability to make icecream as I try to stay away from that stuff.  The unit has a very solid construction.  The stainless steel glass is great.  I just drink my shake from it.  So it saves me from having to wash another glass.  I just have one small issue with it.  You cannot remove the spindle to clean it. You have to use the stainless steel glass with warm, soapy water, put it under the spindle and then rotate it around to clean it.  Well, the problem is this - while I am drinking my shake, the spindle is dripping liquid on the part of the unit that flares out on the bottom.  Okay, okay, it's no big deal, I suppose.  All in all, I like this product, and I would recommend it.
 I LOVE this set.  This was the first "real" cookware I've ever bought.  My husband and I did months of research before purchasing this set.  We've had it now for about 2 months and I can't express how much we've enjoyed it.  I've read several reviews that say food sticks and so on, but I think that perhaps those people think that because it looks similar to non stick, it is.  It's not!  Think of it like this:  It cooks like stainless steel and cleans up like non stick (maybe even better!).  We almost went with the All Clad, but we just couldn't get over how uncomfortable the handles were.  Since I haven't cooked with All Clad, I can't compare the Calphalon One to it, but I will say they heat evenly and cook evenly.  Clean up is SUPER easy!  Just this morning I made bacon and french toast.  I looked at the pans and thought "There is no way I'll ever get this clean!"  I poured some Bar Keeper's friend on it and went to work with my Scotch Brite pad and within MINUTES it was spotless!  Fantastic
 My fiance and I registered for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us.  I have been an avid home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete set of cookware.  This is exactly what the Dr. ordered!  Here's why:1)  Heavy, sturdy construction.  These things can take a beating.  They heat evenly and hold heat very well.2)  You can use metal utensils with them.  I hate plastic spatulas!  We all know that we aren't supposed to use metal with non-stick pans but we all do and then after a while our pan is a useless, peeling shadow of its former self.  Well this isn't the case with Calphalon 1!  Scrape away with any device you have at your disposal with no fear.  3)  They "stick" and sear as well as cast iron cookware (it's a good thing).  This is the best feature for me.  Coated non-stick cookware has its place but if you like to pan sear and get those tasty browned bits for sauces you used to have to use a pan that's not non-stick such as stainless steel or cast iron.  They "stick" for a reason.  You need that contact with the cooking surface to get that great browning.  Now there's the Calphalon 1 which sears as well as cast iron pans but cleans up like a non-stick pan.  It's a no-brainer!  4)  They look cool, have great handles, they're oven-safe, and they come with a lifetime warranty.  4)  They look cool, have great handles, they're oven-safe, and they come with a lifetime warranty.  These are not cheap.  If your primary goal in cookware is super easy cleanup then don't buy this expensive set.  It will dissapoint you.  But, if you want the advantages of traditional cookware combined with easier cleanup in a durable, functional set, and are willing to shell out the $$$ for a top-of-the-line product then this is for you.  Serious cooks who need the correct tools will love this cookware
 This is a great roasting pan and is heavy and solid in the way all All Clad pans are. But it is huge. If you frequently roast 20 lb turkeys or half an ox, this pan is for you. A regular roasting chicken looks pretty small and forlorn. It is a terrifically well-made roaster, but I find I also need one just a bit smaller
 The pot rack came as advertised and it was a snap to put up.  It looks OK and works well with my wall space.  I would purchase this item again
 If you have problems with gripping those round coffee grinders, this one is for you! It's oval shape makes holding it much easier than a round grinder. It grinds well and quickly and is a breeze to clean with just a few flicks of a pastry brush (dedicate one specially for this as it will discolor over time). It's the shape that makes it great
 This is a great thermometer, easy to use and very accurate. It is an essential tool in the kitchen for making perfect candy recipes each time. You should always test your thermometer in boiling water by reaching 212F or 100C before you use it. I like the clip that allows you to attach it to the side of the pot. It's easy to read and dishwasher proof. It's the best!
 My dish for the holidays is always mini-cheesecakes.  It was always frustrating to get them out of my mini-muffin pan.  This pan has made it so easy!  I no longer dread making this dessert.  Just a note though... the cups on this pan are approx twice as big as a regular mini-muffin pan so adjust your recipe accordingly.  I just double my recipe and get bigger mini-cheesecakes.  I don't think anyone will mind
 This is undeniably the best balanced, best constructed, easiest to use knife on the market. I dont use any of my other knives after I bought this... amazing.This is undeniably the best balanced, best constructed, easiest to use knife on the market.

 This is a great skillet for a party or a large family.  We used it on Super Bowl Sunday for BBQ wings.  The skillet kept them warm and looked good as a buffet server, as well. It cleaned up quickly and easily.
 I've been using one of these little gems for over 20 years and it still works flawlessly.  Great output & grind adjustment.  The only other pepper mill that I could recommend (in addition to this one) is the Unicorn Magnum Plus Pepper Mill (9-in.).  The Perfex is "the" pepper mill that every well equipped kitchen should have
 I have seen this set at my friends place ....itsgorgeous!! A bid pricy though compared to other corelle sets
 I never really noticed the inner groove as a "problem" until I read the other reviews. This was part of my first All-Clad set--so nice! Yes, things stick in the groove, but I just use a silicone spatula while cooking and I don't seem to have a problem.  I love the capacity and size/shape of this unit. Scrambled eggs come out beautifully in this pot, as does chocolate ganache and buttercream frosting. But sometimes my pumpkin pie filling gets bits of cooked egg if I'm not diligent about stirring out the groove. The width/depth ratio allows me to really get my whisk or spatula inside to work.

 I had never tried yogurt cheese before, but I was intrigued by the idea.  Making the yogurt cheese was simple with this device - just fill with yogurt and leave it in the fridge.  The product seems sturdy and was easy to clean.  We grow our own raspberries, and I have been eating them with ice cream.  Last night I tried eating them with non-fat yogurt cheese sweetened with a bit of sugar.  It was delicious and much healthier!  Yogurt cheese is a good source of calcium and protein - half a cup has 85 calories, 10 grams protein, 10 grams carbohydrate, and 235 mg calcium. It would be great for layering with fruit in parfaits
 We were looking for a toaster to toast thicker breads such as bagels.  The toaster does this and more.  There is a bagel button you press when toasting bagels and only the outside heating coils come on and toast the center of the bagel!  This is how I like them to be toasted.  The toaster also has a basket that holds the bread/bagel in place while it is being toasted.  This feature is really nice when toasting soft things such as pop-tarts.  Good variance of heat controls too.  I have not found anything bad on this one.  Good choice
 Butter can be better when served in a truly elegant country butter pot. Emile Henry Couleurs does not fail. Buy it, you will  love it. And, have something absolutely unique -- no kidding
 I got rid of my electric can opener when I bought this one.  There is no need for it anymore.  This can opener works like a charm and very easy to use.  Does not take up any space at all.Love it!!!!!!!
 I've had one of these for many years and it recently went on the fritz after a LOT of usage.  I'm getting another.  It can't be beat - and the fact that it's cordless is huge.  You can have a table full of folks for dinner, and walk around freely with your percolator; no unplugging required.  And the coffee comes out delicious
 I bought one of these for my daughter for Christmas and I got this particular one because it had all the attributes she wanted.  She wanted it to be small ehough for just two people and to be able to remove the bowl for cleaning.  This was the ONLY one I found with those attributes.  There were 1 qt. size that were too little and all the bigger ones for big families.  After she got it she liked it so well that I bought one for myself and it works perfectly.  I think the size for a small family and the ease of cleaning are the real selling points for me
 How do YOU cleave your meat? I cleave my meat by meat cleaving it with a meat cleaver
 I own many items from the Le Creuset stoneware collection, and I must say that they are all of superb quality.  This square pan  is perfect for baking and serving my favorite side dishes and desserts.  I have been impressed over and over again at how non-stick the surface of this bakeware is.  Everything I have put into Le Creuset bakeware - brownies, casseroles, refried beans, etc. - has come clean with zero elbow grease.  In fact, the dishwasher usually gets them sparkling clean without my help!  I highly recommend this product as well as everything else from this line
 This is my third Rowenta iron and they have all served me well, but this is by far the best.  The steam is amazing. You only have to made one pass on most items. I know it is a lot of money for an iron but it is worth every penny for the time it saves
 We have been extremely pleased with our tri-ply set (we have the 8-pc. set plus a number of extra pieces we've picked up).  They heat evenly; are durable; the (long) handles really do stay cool; and clean well.We have been extremely pleased with our tri-ply set (we have the 8-pc. set plus a number of extra pieces we've picked up).

We own only one lid that fits more than one pot/pan (the one for the 10 in. pan, 3 qt. saute, 6 qt. stockpot)--and we have 4 other lids which fit only a single pot, some of which are within 1/2 in. of being the same width!Our only complaint is that Calphalon doesn't seem to care about minimizing the number of lids necessary for their cookware.

 I used to have the Calphalon Commercial Non-Stick and I prefer these.  The stainless steel pans seem to heat up faster, are easier to handle and you can put them in the dishwasher (although Calphalon prefers you handwash them).  No problems yet and I don't forsee any.  A great purchase
 Having gone through our share of toaster ovens in 22 years of marriage, this is by far the best.  It's classy looking on the counter, easy to clean, very lightweight, quiet and has alot of options for toasting and baking that make the food come out just as it should.   I can't imagine going back to a traditional toaster oven again. 
 this stockpot is wonderful!! The weight is professional, the size perfect and the handles are great for a little old lady like me!!ha ha! What a fabulous buy!! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you
 I 've been using this apple peeler for about six years.  It still works great and makes pies a breeze.  Even easy enough for kids to use!  Much more stable than the kind you have to clamp to the table
 Excellent Panini Press, sturdy construction, easy clean-up, looks nice just go out and buy one. You won't regret it
 The Villaware Panini Grill has proved to be a very useful appliance, so much so that I leave it out on the counter - it's quite attractive, and certainly not an eyesore.  I use it often, for grilled sandwiches, of course, but also for grilled meats and fish.  I would caution users to avoid meat with bones, e.g. lamb chops(you can't get a good sear when the bone keeps the surface of the meat away from the grill), and to be very careful about timing: things get done twice as fast!  While the cleaning "comb" is useful to get most of the remaining food or fat off the grill, you still need to fold a paper towel and clean each groove separately; much easier to do if the grill is warm (not hot).  I haven't tried grilling vegetables, yet, but it should work perfectly on zucchini sliced the long way, or eggplant, or peppers.I am very happy with the quality of this product
 I'm blown away! With 48 blades, this product really does the job quickly and quietly.  No more BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! echoing off the walls which only produced a flat but still tough piece of meat.  I'd gladly pay twice the cost for the Deni because it works!  It's very sturdy, very sharp and easy to clean in the DW.  I'm using cheaper cuts of meat sucessfully in recipes I had stored away because of toughness or price.  Marinating is faster and more effective, cooking time can be reduced.  Keep it away from kids.  Protect your countertop.  The best kitchen gadget I ever bought!!
 The first time I used it I put a little white vinegar into the water with the eggs and timer. It seemed to cut down on the plastic smell. Also the vinegar will seal your eggs if they crack preventing the insides from leaking out. I did notice the timer has to be completely dark for the eggs to be done instead of the little light circle in the middle like is stated on the packag
 As a person who could set boiling water on fire, I can truely state that this hard boiled egg timer has helped me be able to boil an egg.  Prior to this I never knew if the egg was done and usually I either over cooked them, or worse, under cooked them.  Now they come out perfect everytime.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND
 You either "get" this product or you don't.  It's probably my favorite appliance in my whole house, and I show it off proudly to everyone who comes over.  When I do, some folks look at me like I'm nuts while others instantly begin grinning and nodding their heads.  (Kindred spirits!)instantly begin grinning and nodding their heads.  (Kindred spirits!)Here's the deal.  I hate bending over.  I hate getting my hands dirty with a dustpan.  I don't mind sweeping a room, but for some reason that extra stepof scooping up the pile of dirt and dumping it into the trash can drives me crazy.  (More often than not, I'll just sweep the pile into a corner, prop the broom against the wall over it, and tell myself I'll take care of it later.  Disgusting, I know, but I'm not exactly known for myhousekeeping skills!)housekeeping skills!)Anway, with the Sweep-Eze, all I have to do is sweep the pile under the electric eye.

I love it!I don't have to empty the canister very often, maybe once a month at most.The only drawback is that it's pretty loud and my family gets mad at me ifI don't warn them that I'm about to kick it on.  But as long as I say "Sweep-Eze alert!", they're happy.  And it only stays on for a fewseconds anyway.seconds anyway.Some folks don't get it, but for those who do, this product is invaluable.I'm not sure how I ever got along without it

 I have used different brands of Blenders and Food Processors from various manufacturers in the past, but beleive me or not, this Blender/Food Processor is really the one I am looking for. It has a powerful motor that can easily break ice, plus the Blender jar is made of really thick, unbreakable material, unlike many other Glass Blender jars. One other feature I like about this combo is its wave action technology, which can continuously pull down the mixture in it and this system really works. The Food processor is large enough to chop/mix fruits and vegetables, and above all it saves a lots of space in my kitchen. I have read a lots of bad reviews from many people about other Combos like this, but I don't know what these people are exactly trying to do with a Blender/Food Processor. 
 I've owned a couple of sets of Corelle dinnerware through the years and gave both sets away because I used them so long (without breaking any pieces) that I grew tired of the pattern. This time I decided I wanted a plain white dinnerwear set for everyday use. When I did an Internet search, this Corelle set came up. I bought it, and I'm very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend it
 I love our new white Corelle.  It is so light and takes up much less room in the cabinet. 
 Let's face it, you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated.  Nice furniture and practical book shelves.  But you do not live alone; there is probably a canine or feline lurking around.  It may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of Garfield on it or some cutesy saying.  But in the long run this durable, multi use, dishwasher safe, bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he/she wants a few laps of water.Let's face it, you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated.

 This is an extremely nice cutting board, great size and easy to handle.  Cleans up in a breeze.  No stains and does not dull those favorite knives.  I have the larger size but this one is my favorite
 I purchased this press to supplement a larger 8-cup model.   The press allows just under one standard size mug to be filled.  If you also are looking for a mug's worth of coffee, I would recommend purchasing the 4-cup model as that would leave just a bit more room, and keep more of the small grindings in the press, rather than in the bottom of my cup.  Also, it should be noted that Bodum sells the spare parts for this press (right here on Amazon, in fact), so if you should break it, a few dollars will get you back in Java!  Another note, some people have mentioned that dumping the grindings proves problematic as you can't just put them down the drain (plugs up your trap).  I have found an easy solution in using the plastic and wire mesh grind basket of my last automatic coffee maker as a strainer.  I just pour the bit of water and grinds out of the press and into the basket (which I leave in the sink), and allow the water to run off.  Then I pour shake the dry coffee into the trash.  No fuss, and the basket is dishwasher safe for the occasional cleaning
      For ideal coffee using a French press is the best method.  It takes a bit more time and effort, but results in much better tasting coffee.  This is because due to the lower temperatures and the lack of a paper filter the coffee oils stay in tact.  This adds a lot of flavor to the coffee that is lost otherwise.       As for this French press in particular: size does matter.  If you make enough coffee that you aren't drinking by the single mug then just get a bigger press.  I drink about a pot and half of coffee most week days and find the effort required to use this smaller press a hassle.  As such I just keep this press at home and only use it in the evenings. 
 I've used this knife for nearly two years and I love it!  It fits perfectly in my hand and takes a razor sharp edge with little effort.  This knife sold me on the entire four star line
 We love this thing.  The steamer takes up far less room for both storage and use than a regular standing ironing board.  We have a small house and not alot of wiggle room, so space saving is key for us. Also,I hate ironing; sleeves, collars and touchy fabrics can be a bear.  With the steamer I just drag the wand and go, so far easy as pie.  On some types of fabrics or clothing details I can see where a little touch with a traditional iron would be beneficial, but overall we love this thing.

 Everything about this set is well done. The packaging and the size of the plates.
 I'm glad I bought this griddle! I've been stuck with teflon-coated nonstick pans for a while, and when I saw such great deals on cast iron pans, I had to buy a few. I ordered the griddle, the ~10" Logic grill pan, and the ~10" skillet. Thankfully all three qualified for free Super Saver shipping, because the cost to ship was more than the cost of the pans themselves! The order was placed late Monday night, and I was promised that my pans would ship by the following Monday. By Wednesday the griddle had arrived, and the grill pan showed up on Friday. Way to go, UPS! It turns out that its good to get these things early, because it takes a few days to get the "natural finish" pans properly seasoned. I think most of the complaints found in user reviews of cast iron cookware could have been avoided entirely had the reviewers simply taken the time to season their pans properly. Food won't stick to a cast iron pan if you've taken the time to season it until it's black and almost totally non-stick. It takes some time and paitence, but it's the same way with a good wok: you get out of it what you put into it, and this certainly reflects in one's cooking. Iif you're going to buy one of these pans, DO YOUR HOMEWORK! Ask Google about cast iron seasoning tips and instructions and you too can have an awesome cast iron pan. If you want to save some time, just buy the Logic line of pans, because saving the effort of seasoning is probably worth the massive price increase (the logic griddle is nearly double the price of the original). Keep in mind that you will eventually have to re-season the pan, but hopefully not for a while (we'll see how the grill pan turns out).I'm glad I bought this griddle!

I am a pretty physically fit chef, and I still find the griddle to be pretty hefty. A little extra ease of carrying a heavy piece of what's usually very hot iron would be great. I've found that grabbing it with a folded cotton (natural fibers don't melt!) towl helps, or if you're serious about using cast iron (and you like to sear meat on it) you should invest in a pair of welder's gloves or something equally thick and heavy and fireproof.I agree with some of the other reviews, the handle could stand to be made a little longer.

You have not LIVED until you eat pancakes cooked on a hot cast iron surface. Teflon-coated pans simply cannot compare. I can't wait to try making grilled-cheese sandwiches, omelettes, and hashed browns on this griddle. With any luck, this will be the last griddle I ever need to buy (and hopefully the griddle my grandchildren won't have to buy)
 Pfaltzgraff products are always reliably good, the Pistoulet dinnerware actually makes me feel cheerful when I use it. The colors are great and the designs are whimsical. I bought two sets in different colors and mix and match which makes the eating experience even more fun. I want to start collecting all the fun serving pieces too. The only thing I didn't like was taking stickers off each piece in the box. That always makes me crazy, it should be against the law to put stickers on dishes
 I'm a student at a massage therapy school and i only have two sheet sets, so i wash these at least twice a week and they aren't showing any wear at all (i've had them for about 2 months).

 The angled slots are useful and easier than top loaders.  The right pull pushes the bread up once toasted, I love this feature.  The bagel toaster is handy as is the stop button.  All of the buttons and pulls are easy and intuitively obvious, you don't need a degree to operate it.  It looks interesting on my counter since it doesn't look like the typical toaster.  I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that a large slice of bread doesn't fit all the way in, the slots could have been a  bit larger.  They are wide enough for fat bread.  I really like this toaster so far. 
 hands down the best non-stick tongs I've ever purchased.  Definitely worth the money!
 These pans are a great value . They are heavy duty and will last for a long time. I do alot of baking and need to freguently replace them. They  heat evenly to prevent burning. The extra large size cuts my time in half so I can spend more time enjoying the end results with my family. The silverstone coating makes clean-up a breeze. They are alittle heavy so they are not the best if you want those little hands to help in the baking. These pans are a must have for all
 Kitchens Etc put price stickers on the outsides of each bowl.  These are not coming off easily at all. Each one of them has a sticky, white adhesive mess on the side. The bowls themselves are cute

 The Senseo delivers a good, hot cup of coffee in either single or double mode. It's easy to fill, easy to use, easy to clean, and accepts any suitably shaped coffee pod. The only mild annoyance is the rattly cup tray during the brew-pump operation
 This cooker makes the best jasmine rice if you measure 1 1/2 cups raw, jasmine rice into the cooker, wash it under cold water for 3 washings, and then fill the cooker with water up just under the 2 cup mark (more like 1 1/2 cups water) with the washed rice still in the cooker.

 I learned a long time ago, if you go KitchenAid, you go for life. They make the highest quality, longest life products I have ever seen. This hand mixer is the third of its kind I've owned. I've had two of the Braun models and they died out after about a year of average use. I finally got the KitchenAid and it has been going strong for a few years now. I really like having the ability to go down to the bottom of a large pot, a full 8". Even though it is of substantial weight, it fits your hand like a glove. I found it far superior to the Braun, as a matter of fact, it doesn't even compare.The plastic cup with lid makes an excellent accessory since you can mix and store without wasting time. The chopper is the most efficient I have seen, does a better job that a food processor. I especially like the multi-speed dial. It goes from 1 to 9 so it has the power you need, when you need it. Egg white or whip cream doesn't even challenge it, the whipping attachment makes sure of that.  This baby  handles like a pro. There are times when you don't need the big mixer and the immersion blender really fills in nicely. You won't be disappointed with the quality, power or its sleek look
 Cooks evenly as all get out, cleans up fine in the dishwasher, and the non-stick coating seems to work just fine, but the thing weighs more than my Grandpa's old blue Buick!

 I'm a true Longaberger fan, but since they're getting out of control on their prices lately, I thought I'd try something else.  This piece by far is the ONLY piece of pottery that I've found that can stand up to Longaberger's quality.  This dish cleans beautifully and holds a nice-sized lasagna.  I'm very, very happy with it and only wish I'd found the Le Creuset brand before now.  Grab this dish - it will quickly become your favorite!  I love the color
 I hate taking out the vacuum and trying to find a plug for it.  This means I wait until I absolutely have to use the vacuum and the house is a mess.  This thing is so light and convenient that I pull it out whenever there is a mess and I don't hate doing it.  I have had it for about 3 months now and the battery is great.  In fact I keep forgetting to plug it back in and it still is always ready for me.  It works great on my wood floor and area rugs.

You're buying with confidence when you purchase All Clad.  The name speaks for itself, quality!  You will not be disappointed
 Very lightweight - can use it on a magazine even - clipping it to the bottom of the magazine works well.  Plenty of light to read by too - I sometimes don't need my reading glasses when using it
 The pitcher does what it's supposed to do and is easy to clean.  My only wish is that they would make a pitcher like this microwavable and with lines showing the ounces of the contents.  That way you could pour the amount you need and pre-warm the milk in the pitcher prior to frothing, achieving better & faster & more convenient results
 I just received this set the other day, and am absolutely thrilled. It is top-notch quality, and the pieces are very heavy. My silverware drawer looks so pretty and perfect, I am tickled every time I open it! It is definitely the last set I'll ever need. And at this price,(and free shipping to boot) there is no better deal anywhere
 This is my favorite salad spinner, and I've tried several over the last couple years.  It dries my lettuce very well, and has some useful features that I haven't seen in other spinners.This is my favorite salad spinner, and I've tried several over the last couple years.

But with this one the more you pull, the faster it spins, kind of like revving up a top or something.   It spins much faster than those 'crank' spinners or the 'push down' type -and faster spinning means more water off your veggies.Like the old Zyliss spinner, you pull on a handle to spin the basket.

Kind of like watching your clothes roll around in the dryer.1) The lid is clear, so you can see the veggies spinning around in there and make sure you're not overfilling the spinner, the lettuce isnt bunching up in one corner, etc. OK, it's also just mesmerizing to watch your food spin round and round.

So after you've whipped  your veggies into a frenzy, you can slam them to a stop -which also helps get more water off.  This works better on the small sized spinner, since there is less weight to stop, but even on the big spinner it works very well.  I have seen a brake on another spinner, but this one works much better.2) There is a brake!

You'd have to take the lid off and wind it up yourself!  This new design winds the cord up every time.3) The cord pulls itself back in -and gently: I disliked how the old 'string' spinners would yank on your arm, and if you didn't respond just right the string wouldn't pull in at all: it ends up just sitting there in a pile.

The handle even sits in its own little pocket in the lid so that it's not in the way.  In my house fridge space is valuable and I appreciate being able to stack this spinner like I do with my tupperware.5) You can stack things on top of it, both in the fridge and in the cupboard, because the top is mostly flat.

It does its job very well and has thoughtful extra features which make it more helpful around the kitchen
 I bought the Hot Diggity Dogger many years ago. We are still using it!! My kids have made their own hot dogs for years. My middle one loves it. He is getting his own place now and I am going to get him one for Christmas. He has used it the most. He loves it. It is the only appliance that I have ever gotten that has truly paid for itself
 I picked this up on a special promotion for ~$20, and for that price it is unbeatable.  Has held up for years of regular use & dishwasher cleaning.  Be sure to get some soft spatulas with your first non-stick pan purchase...

But, being able to make 6 medium sized loaves at one time more than makes up for decrease in browning.
 I've made everything from braised short ribs to homemade Mole in this and I can truly say it is fabulous.  Goes from stovetop to oven perfectly and retains heat better than any cookware I've used. Cannot reccomend it highly enough
 Worked very well when whipping up a roux. The heavy disc bottom did a good job of evenly distributing heat and didn't scorch. The rounded sides meant that I had no problem getting a whisk into the sides of the pan. Cleaned up easily and looks really nice. Whoever designed this stuff got the shape and materials right; it is very aesthetically pleasing.Worked very well when whipping up a roux.

I find this cleaner shines up all my stainless steel to like-new condition with no scrubbing or scratching. It also works to keep the copper banding looking shiny
 I bought a dozen of these from another retailer (at half price) and I love them! They are perfect for everything that requires a small size container.  I use the cups to beat two eggs, melt butter, heat up baby food (never heat food in any plastic), to serve ketchup or other condiments, store a small amount of leftovers, etc. By using the appropriately sized cup, I save a lot of space in both the fridge and the dishwasher.  I recommend these highly
 ... and I don't even make Custard! *LOL*  I just love these for small servings of ice cream, fruit, side dishes, etc.  They are great with meals for anything that you don't want to mix with the other foods on your plate.  They are perfect for snacks and desserts.  They are great for things such as pickles, olives, chopped onions, relish, dips, etc. on a casual buffet or picnic table.  They also work well for pre-portioning ingredients when making a complicated recipe or allowing younger kids to cook with you.  The typical Pyrex glass which is thick and a bit heavy is perfect for my family because it holds up to less than gentle everyday use.  I still want my children to learn to be careful with china and glassware, but I see no reason to be too 'precious' about everday dishware
 *****I bought two sets of four bowls to complement my nice set of everyday dishes for times when you want just a little bit of something---like a little yogurt, or some granola, some fresh raspberries---and we use them all the time.

 These small cups come in handy for making custard, warming baby food and for individual servings of snacks, and food items,etc.  Delivery was prompt. They don't seem to be available in the department stores or discount stores anymore so was delighted to find them on line.  Lynn Martin in Va
 Lots of reviews already, so let's not waste your time:Lots of reviews already, so let's not waste your time:Pros:- easy to setup (no waiting for charcoal or having to buy propane)- easy to clean- practical.

 This little grill is not so little, with a large grill surface, but it takes up so little space on my apartment's patio - so it is perfect for those of us who only have a small patio or balcony. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and grills perfectly - no mess, no fuss.
 I'm sticking with the lighter colors due to scratching.  My persimmon 16 piece setting arrived with two dinner plates scratched.  I think next time I'll order them as individual place settings as they weren't packed well.  Amazon will give me a 20% discount for keeping them. 
 I like this place setting color, but I have taken the advice of others and I use coffee filters between pieces for storage.  It is a great place setting
 I've been using mine almost daily for cooking and/or laundry, and it is still running off the original battery after more than 6 months. The one small criticism that I have is that the buttons are too easily pushed, and I can't stick it in my pocket without stopping it or changing the setting somehow.  Other than that, it's ALL good..
 I bought this timer, because my husband wanted one similar to the one his mom had, with the big display and the simple, three-button operation. This particular timer was better priced than most I looked at, and I liked the extra large display. I have been very happy with it. The buttons don't stick like other timers I have used. I like the way the memory feature works, and the bonus feature that it can count up is also nice
 Had this on my Amazon wish list, but then came across it for the same price at a Target store and bought it (sorry Amazon). And I really am pleased so far. My toddler has allergies and his allergist had recommended an air purifier for his room. We did lots of research in looking for the right one that was still affordable. I really like that this one has washable filters. Lots of $$$ savings there. Since getting this, my son has had fewer runny noses and no severe allergy symptons. We've even been able to drop two of his three allergy meds - - not sure yet though if this is due to the seasons, or perhaps we were possibly over-medicating him before, or if this thing really does work that kind of miracle. Either way, fewer snotty noses makes me happy. In regard to the concerns over noise, this one is fairly quiet. I keep it on low pretty much all the time and it is hardly noticeable. My son has no problem sleeping with it running in the same room. The oscillating feature is nice and it has a small nightlight on it that comes in handy. I would definitely recommend the Honeywell HFD 120.
 I bought this heater three years ago based on the good reviews and cheap price.  I expected it to get me through that winter only.  I have used this thing just about daily for the past three years, heat in fall/winter and fan in summer.  It still works quite well and seems ready for the upcoming winter.  The only problem I am beginning to notice now is that the on/off/heat control wheel is starting to become loose.  Otherwise it does a great job for the intended task and has already lasted longer than anticipated.  The thermostat on it is finicky and takes a little playing around with it to do basically what you want but the heat does cycle on/off more or less appropriately.  I'd give 5 stars if the thermostat was perfect but it is what it is and that is good enough.  I just bought two more, my old one will go to the garage for duty there until it eventually fails.  A good, solid product for a very good price
 Best 20$ I've ever spent. It does have some flaws as stated previously in other reviews, the knobs are hard to read but I've found that I use it so much that I really don't need to be able to see it anymore. The thermometer seems stable, I never have a problem with it getting too hot in the winter, and it manages to heat my efficiency apartment very well. The cord is 'regular' length so it's not tiny and I don't need an extension cord. Over all on a students budget I've definitely found a winner
 I've had another press for many years, but I couldn't get to it and had cravings for some Spritz cookies. So... I went out and bought this cookie press and to my amazement was very impressed with all the additional accessories it came with. The press worked beautifully (I've only used the small barrel so far.) I was concerned that it was battery operated, my last one was a plug in model. But it is nice not to be limited to working near a plug. We had no problems with the unit, it worked quite nicely. I'm looking forward to trying out some of the accessory attachments in the future. I would definitely recommend this press to anyone looking to buy a cookie press
 Works great!  Makes small amounts of delicious coffee!  Very handy
 We have had this dinnerware for several years. It really is beautiful. However, it chips quite easily (or maybe we are just a bit rough with 4 kids!) and so I find I have to buy some new ones each year so I have enough unchipped plates when company comes
 This product works wonders! I am big into making my own flavors, and making healthier than store bought versions.  This machine is great for that! It isn't loud at all, definately a big upgrade from the salt and ice mixer I used to have that could wake up the dead.  The fact that you just pop your ingredients in the canister and stick it in is amazing, no messy clean up whatsoever, or need for trips to the store for ice/salt.  The only slight disadvantage is that if you want to add toppings that spread throughout, you need to add it after its almost at icecream consistency and for that you have to pop off the top (theres no slide window to add through while its mixing).   But even doing that extra step is simple after 30 min's of churning.  Soft ice cream DEFINATELY never takes longer than 45, usually 37-40, and hard is about 45-48 min.   Buy it and Enjoy!!
 This Cloth Cover is great and made from a very good material, but it doesn't quite fit the 6 quart KitchenAid mixer it is a few inches short
 Great little item and we use it every week. Wonderful with non-stick surfaces. I want another one
 Got damaged in shipping ...but amazon happily replaced with a new one..Great CS amazon.ThanksGot damaged in shipping ...but amazon happily replaced with a new one..Great CS amazon.ThanksHad to send back the broken one back to amazon
 Ordered on June 4 and received on June 12 (one day earlier than anticipated).  Was thrilled with the quality and even more with the fact that it comes fully assembled except for the adjustable shelves which are a snap to put in.  Nice looking cabinet and I may order another one at a later date.  Couldn't be happier with the product and with the servic
 I have used other egg cookers before, I like this one, but I am having to guess on the amount of water to get thew right soft boiled eggs.  Mine keep coming out almost hard boiled even though I use the soft boiled marks.
 We have had this knife for about 5 months now, and we use it daily; anything from peeling and dicing fruit, to slivering a potato.It has a nice solid feel to it, and it has a remarkably sharp blade, which has held an edge very well.  The curved blade makes it a bit of a challenge to hone
 This knife has a great balance in your hand, good quality stainless steel, easy to sharpen and clean, as well as a comfy grip handle
 Excellent product for the value. I was hesitant to purchase china via internet or mail, but the china arrived in perfect condition, and is beautiful and timeless. Thank you.
 Darling tea pot.  Beautiful colors!  Serves several people.  Just lovely
 The table comes unassembled, but assembly is easy. You will need a large phillips and medium sized phillips screwdrivers. Also the supports on the side for the top will need to be driven on using a hammer, or large chunk of scrap wood. The fit on mine was too tight to be simply slid on. Construction is the cam type that is popular now. All pieces are adequately labled, and small hardware comes nicely packaged; the most convenient I have ever seen. There is an error in the assembly documentation. There are two pieces (1B and 1C, the table sides) which are as far as I can tell are identical. After hardware is installed as indicated on pabe 6 of 13 there is a difference. The two sides are mirror images. On the following page part 1C is shown but labled 1B. This error did not cause me a problem during assembly. The intent was clear to me.The table comes unassembled, but assembly is easy.

 We've gotten into homemade custard-based ice cream and that means careful stirring to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot. The design of the working end of the whisk allows the head to reach every bit of the pot but without my having to twist my stirring arm into a knot. Since the head is hinged, it lies flat in a drawer which is a good thing, too
 This kettle is very stylish with modern detailing.  The removable whistle and stay-cool handle are added pluses.  Its smooth lines make it very easy to clean, and its contemporary shape makes it especially attractive
 I love this tea kettle.  It not only looks great but is of heavy duty construction unlike those $10 aluminum throw-aways.  Since I am only an occasional tea drinker, I tend to leave water in the kettle and move it to hot burners when cooling (I have cast iron elements/electric oven so burners stay hot for awhile after use).  Other tea kettles create rusty water, since water remains in the kettle.  Not this one!  It boils water rapidly and is great looking on the stove.  My handle does not get hot and, like I said, I have cast iron elements which really heat up and remain hot.  I do agree that you cannot take the whistle off without an oven mit.  That's the only flaw; they should have made the whistle heat resistant like the handle
 I add lots of cheese to my pizzas and it tends to get all over the pan.  With other pans, the cheese sticks and I have to pry the pizza off with a spatula. BUT NOT THIS ONE!!  It just slides right off with one shake.  My party pizzas come out crisp and heated evenly.  Also, I have cut my pizzas on this pan and there was barely a scratch on it.  Very heavyweight with no warping.  What a buy! 
 The heater is great. If it had a timer it would be even greater. However, it serves the intended purpose well. The "cool to the touch" feature is perfect since I have a toddler. I never leave it unattended but it's nice to know that if the baby somehow gets close to it there won't be a diaster
 They were a little stiff when first opened, but that is to be expected.  After just two washings with fabric softener and a couple extra dryer sheets, I fell in love with them.  I am now so protective of my sheets, not allowing my husband or children anywhere near them with dirty hands or food!  I am going to get an extra set just in case something happens to this set.  I would highly recommend buying these and I am very picky
 There is no guess work with a name brand like Pyrex, you know your gonna get quality
 Heavy-duty without being too heavy for a fairly weak cook to shift about. Easy to clean, both inside and out. One expects easy cleaning of non-stick interior, but the stainless steel outside comes clean with nothing more than hot, soapy water. The thick aluminum exterior bottom spreads heat evenly. I am impressed by the non-stick coating that seems impervious to ordinary wear, but will reserve judgment on that point for the one-year anniversary of my purchase
 I've had this yogurt maker for about six months now and have been very pleased with the results.  I heat up the milk in my microwave (recording the times in my owner's manual so I always know just what to do) and my total hands-on time is only about five minutes from start to finish.

 Its amazing how much dirt this little baby sucked off our couch and upholstry.  The ability to make the suction head vertical is quite helpful.  The vaccum cleaner is a bit on the heavy side though - if it had been a little lighter, I would have given it 5 stars

I wasn't going to buy this pan at first, cause it was the "Simply", But I'm not sorry at all...  I have alot of Calphalon Commercial (at least 20), and yes it's thicker, But I think this cooks very well. Being that this is abit lighter, I find when its filled up, its heavy enough for me, and easyier to handle. The price is also alot less then the Calphalon Commercial.Since you most likely would not use this pan everyday, I would think you would not need a lifetime warentee like the Commercial gives you , if you use it the right way.Since you most likely would not use this pan everyday, I would think you would not need a lifetime warentee like the Commercial gives you , if you use it the right way.  I have sauted hamburger meat,onions, peppers ect. emptyed the fat off, added sauses, and continued cooking everything together, then puting this into the oven to finish it off..Never a problem.Never a problem.  I have used this for making Large Egg Omelets, the cheese has never stuck. Use it for fryed potatoes with low fat cheese, and I don't need to use alot of oil,The nonstick works fine. I have used this for sauteing Pasta with sauses..  This is a large size, so you can put alot into this and have left overs. You can make pancakes, frenched toast, I would think anything you want..I guess what I'm saying is, you can use this size for anything.    I do have the Calphalon Commercial double gridle, but if you don't have room for all the peices that I have, this can cover alot. I have found this to cook even, and you don't need to turn your stove on high. I have found this to cook even, and you don't need to turn your stove on high.

I don't understand Amazon's priceing , as sometimes the Calphalon Commercial can be less money!!So I would say, take the time and check out your other options, as the Calphalon Commercial has more layers of nonstick and is a higher quality, but don't let that scare you off from buying this one
 Cuisinart DCO-24 Die Cast is the best can opener. I've owned mine for a year, and love it! If I could give it 10 stars I would.
 I was expecting some of the dinnerware to be broken in transit and was shocked when I opened it up.  Everything was intact, nothing broken to include the 4 drinking glasses.  This dinnerware is EXCELLENT!  The pattern is simple and is extremely easy to clean.  I think everyone should have this set in their kitchen.  :
 I figured "what the heck" on this comforter.  Similar products at major brick & mortar retailers cost upwards of $100.  My wife and I have been using it for several months now and are both extremely happy with the quality.  It is soft enough to sleep under without a flat sheet or to drape over ourselves while watching a movie on the couch.  Excellent purchase
 I had tried a different ice cream maker that you had to freeze the bowl and returned it. It was too annoying to keep freezing the bowl and it took up too much space in my freezer. I love the cuisinaret Ice-50bc it makes great ice cream. The only negative is the noise and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is extremely noisy so I pretty much have to leave the room when it's on. I do recommend the Ben and Jerry's ice cream book but wish they would revise it or do another one. See my review on it
 After my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with severe cat and dust allergies. I had two cats at the time. And dust? Well, alot of that. I cannot believe how well this vacuum works. I no longer have hives and haven't had any allergic reactions since purchasing this. Worth every penny
 I have always missed my old toastter of yesteryear....this is as close as it gets --with some good updates==I lever that pushes up the toast so you don't have to dig in---fantastic toast....
 If you want the retro look and a super toaster.....this is the one for you. Toasts perfectly and looks great! I've had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever
 This is by far the nicest omelet pan ever.  Super easy cleanup too!  I love the way it stands up to high heat and still comes clean

 I have a set of 16-year-old Farberware.  I ordered this 3 qt. pan as a replacement--the handle on my old 3 qt. cracked from where the screw hole is.  After I received this beautiful pan, I noticed the limited lifetime guarantee, called the number, and a new handle for my old pan is in the mail to me as we speak.  This 3 qt. pan is even nicer than the pans I bought almost 20 years ago and is higher than the old model with a nicer lid/rolled edges and nicer bottom--and it really is beautiful--very classic styling.  Since I use them so often and new one's so lovely, I will definitely keep the new one even though a replacement handle is on its way.I have a set of 16-year-old Farberware.

 we are very happy with the knives we've purchased.  They are really sharp and do well in the dishwasher
 I have been extremely happy with this set of knives, and for only $40 I believe them to be an excellent value. The blades are sharp and well constructed, and the handles are comfortable and seem durable. The set only comes with two long knives, so you may find yourself washing them while cooking, but we like to use the steak knives for chopping smaller vegetables or trimming meat and have thus rarely found that we are short on knives while cooking. If you're looking to do professional work, these knives probably won't fit your needs, but for an average cook, we use them a lot and haven't found anything they can't handle. Plus, you are getting the set for about $3 per knife, and these knives would run at least $10 to $15 each if purchased individually or at a local retailer.  
 Rack stores easily, sets up quickly and provides drying space for double batch of noodles, spag, etc
 This is the second Microplane grater that I have purchased (actually I purchased the extra coarse version), but the only 1 of the 2 that I would give a 5* rating to. The other grater was from the standard line not the professional line. With many kitchen items there are no significant differences between the two, but in this case it definitely matters!This is the second Microplane grater that I have purchased (actually I purchased the extra coarse version), but the only 1 of the 2 that I would give a 5* rating to.

With many kitchen items there are no significant differences between the two, but in this case it definitely matters!All Microplane graters use the same basic technology for cutting -- technology which was originally developed for the woodworking industry but that has adapted for exceptional service in the kitchen as well. The razor sharp laser cut grating head will make quick & easy work of cheese grating or citrus zesting (if you have the proper size). I would suggest when choosing a size of grater that you choose 1 size larger as the sizing tends to run on the small size.All Microplane graters use the same basic technology for cutting -- technology which was originally developed for the woodworking industry but that has adapted for exceptional service in the kitchen as well.

I would suggest when choosing a size of grater that you choose 1 size larger as the sizing tends to run on the small size.Now, what makes the professional so much better? Well, the standard line has 3 major/minor flaws: 1) the easy-grip rubber handle tends to capture water when washed, 2) the plastic molded frame holding the grating surface cracks when washed in the dishwasher, & 3) the head is so incredibly sharp that it must be kept covered, yet there is no easy way to due this except for the original tagboard cover.Now, what makes the professional so much better?

 I make homemade stocks a lot, so having a good separater that can handle a large quantity is really useful. This one works well, and thanks to its design, it cleans up easily in the dishwasher. I have another one with a very thin spout and I have to wash it by hand if I let it sit at all after using it because the dishwasher jets can't seem to get into its narrow opening; it's a real pain. I do not have that problem with this design.  I make homemade stocks a lot, so having a good separater that can handle a large quantity is really useful.

I do not have that problem with this design.  To answer another reviewers' question on plasic vs. glass separaters -- I had a glass one and it broke despite being touted as heat resistant glass. When I poured hot gravy into it last Thanksgiving, the glass went flying everywhere as it broke right in my hand! Admittedly, that was an older one and perhaps the newer glass versions are more rugged when it comes to heat. But I just don't have that worry using a plastic one. I'm not an industrial designer, but given the way that plastic is made at exceptionally high heat, I am not aware of any health implications regarding pouring warm liquids into plastic
 My sister, my best friend and I bought these chairs for a 5 day outdoors concert series.  These chairs were amazing.  They managed to last through rain, mud, 80 per hour winds, and even a TORNADO! (They still look great)  These chairs were so comfortable and so easy to adjust because of the beans, I would recommend them to everyone..and at their price, it's a HUGE DEAL! 
 This iron is a technological marvel.  I have just had it for a few days and I have ironed some very difficult, over 100 year, heirloom open-embroidered linen.  It was a breeze and the results were truly professional.  The controlls are easy to use, the steam settings excellent.  It just glides over those diffucult spots.  It may be a little pricey, but it is worth every penny.This iron is a technological marvel.

I was concerned about the weight, but the iron glides so effortlesly that you do not notice the weight.
 This product is extremely quiet.  My cat loves it and its great because it encourages her to drink more
 Very pleased to get this item - I need it for my "king-size" watrbed mattress, which has California King dimensions. Unable to find this size locally. This one fitted really well, had enough depth to stretch around the waterbed mattress. Quality seems good
 I was a little dubious about this item.  Some of the reviews indicated that it did not really have deep pockets.  Well, I can tell you that it does.  My mattress is a pillow-top measuring in at 16 inches and this mattress pad accomodates it perfectly.  So, do not believe the nay-sayers; for the price this is a bargain which should not be passed up
 This is in my opinion the best waffle iron you can purchase for home use. There might be a better $600 waffle iron out there, but this is far and away and excellent product. Although I do feel that it's a little flimsy to be called a "professional" product, and seeing as how I've worked in the food industry my whole life, I feel validated in saying that. However, I have used it for a while now, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. From soft to crisp waffles in a short amount of time, any easy to use and clean. My ony complaint is that it's rather large for the size of my kitchen. Excellent waffles! Thick and golden, like in the user submitted photos. I've never had waffles so good, not even in a restaurant. The true Belgian waffle recipes do take a bit of patience and know-how, but they're worth the effort. I read some complaints about the timing mechanism, but I find it to be spot on for the most part. Its worth the money
 Ok...the only thing domestic about me is that I live in a house.  Cooking is a necessary evil.  This waffle maker is the best!  We love staying at hotels w/breakfast bars just so we can use the waffle makers!  Two things I have noticed about this appliance...I have 3 kids and a husband that all love the waffles, so when we use it I am making a lot of waffles.  If it starts to appear the waffles are getting more crisp, dial down the heat setting one less than what you are currently set on.  We start out with a "4" setting.  I am in the habit of spritzing the grids EVERY time we bake a waffle.  If you miss between, the waffles don't stick, but it is apparent they don't slip right out as easy.  I have found that a butter flavored cooking spray gives the waffle more of a "restaurant" taste.  We use the box batters...there is no way in hell I would take the time to make the book mix...LOL.  I've used more expensive mixes to store brand mixes ($1.99/box) and they all bake up great.  Ok...the only thing domestic about me is that I live in a house.  Cooking is a necessary evil.

BE SURE TO HAND WASH THE BATTER CUP if you don't want the writing to come off.  I have scratched mine with an ice pick to show the proper level.  Also, I have a small spatula on hand I use to spread the thicker mixes around (quickly) if need be.

 The Black plastic looks a little odd.  It's not glossy like the picture.  It doesn't look really clean even after you clean it is the only way I can discribe it.  I bought 2 of these for the office to replace our old ones because we burnt a Pop Tart and the rest of the building was less that thrilled that the Fire Department had to respond. This one is suppose to shut down if something gets stuck in it.  Good Idea.  But, the instructions still say not to cook Pop Tarts unattended anyway.  Now they tell us.  There is a toaster with a Pop Tart Logo, the Toastmaster 2035.  If you want a laugh, read the review for that one.  Bottom line, for the money, this toaster works great.  I like the lift feature a lot.  But, I'd buy the white next time
 Yes, it's rather uncomely - it's outer casing is obviously plastic and, ours at least, doesn't have that same sheen as the example.  It does look cheap.  THAT being said, it's a VERY functional toaster.  We've had NO problems in six+ months with variability - we know what we're going to get when we drop the lever.  The plastic exterior DOES STAY COOL.  So cool, in fact, that I promise you, you will forget normal toaster safety and burn yourself on the small exposed metal at the top.  Yep, this is a GREAT toatser for someone who wants a functioning toaster and doesn't mind that it's an ugly duckling.  An EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE MONEY
 If you have a large dishwasher these are wonderful dishes, they are not only beautiful, but sturdy, and I was so impressed to see that they had a one year break and chip warrenty with them. Anyway they are wonderful and we love them.
 This is a great food slicer for the home kitchen, (dont compare apples with oranges, this isnt a commercial slicer, but it wasnt advertised as one either) it works great for anything from bacon to tomatos. It has a powerfull motor and a very sharp blade with infinite thinkness adjustments up to a 1/2&quot;, easy to clean and very well built. If you want a good slicer for home use you'll be happy with a waring food slicer
 I totally love these pans... Next go round I would definately order more of the same,, as I am hard on frying pans, and love these immensel
 I had bought the larger set in BLUE and ordered these pans in BLUE as well. Thinking that they would match the pieces I already owned, I was quite disappointed when I received BLACK instead of the BLUE I ordered. I returned them and Amazon replaced them with another set of BLACK pans. I decided to keep them but am quite upset, with my only alternative being to return them for credit.I had bought the larger set in BLUE and ordered these pans in BLUE as well.

You will NOT be able to mistreatthese pans by turning the flame up on full. To do so will causethe pans to warp.the pans to warp.The advantage to these pans is that they are LIGHTWEIGHT and easyto handle. I definitely recommend them. As with all TEFLON coated pans, be sure to use the PLASTICutensils and NEVER use any metal spoons or turners or you willruin the Teflon surface. With a little care these will last foryears!years!TIP: If you're having trouble with the bottom of your pots andpans getting a scorched or burnt look, it's from GREASE. Whenyou wash your pans, make sure all the grease is cleaned off ofthe outside bottom of the pans

 I PURCHASED THIS ITEM IN AUG.   I CLEANED THE ENTIRE HOUSE AND IT WORKED WONDERFUL.  IT WAS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND VERY EASY TO CLEAN UP WHEN FINISHED.   I GIVE THIS ITEM A 5 STAR.

 I bought the Omega 8002 Juicer on the recommendation of Dr. Joseph Mercola, a holistic health MD who has a popular newsletter and website. We met him at a health fair, tried vegetable juices (including wheatgrass juice) and realized that juicing was a great way to incorporate more vegetables into our diet. I mean, how much broccoli and salad can one person pound down in a day? Not so much.

The Omega 8002 is a single gear machine that turns at a low 80 RPMs, a powerful, slow auger that doesn't heat up the food or cause the juice to foam. This protects the nutritional content of the juice from degradation. In addition, it is "multifunctional"--the juicer can also be employed to make baby food, meat pate, nut butter, or fine ground coffee. The machine is durable, said to be quiet, and has a 10-year guarantee. Sounds good, so we plunked down the cash and got the Omega juicer and set to work.

Well, it's EASY to put together, though there are quite a few parts and choices to make. Essentially, the steps are:1. Install the screw drive--the big green plastic spiral, into the plastic housing.2. Pop a juicing cone (a type of sieve) over the screw so it sits into the housing around the screw. This takes a bit of jockeying, but it drops in just fine. 3. Screw on the end cap and nozzle.4. Mount this housing onto the front of the juicer motor.5. Add the food platform on top of the feed tube on the housing.6. Put the two receiving pitchers underneath the housing; one for the pulp, one for the juice.6. Put the two receiving pitchers underneath the housing; one for the pulp, one for the juice.Now it's ready to start juicing.   1. Cut up your vegetables into strips or pieces that will fit the 1.5 inch diameter of the feed tube. This means if you juice carrots, those tasty large ones need to be halved or quartered lengthwise. 1. Cut up your vegetables into strips or pieces that will fit the 1.5 inch diameter of the feed tube. This means if you juice carrots, those tasty large ones need to be halved or quartered lengthwise. 2. Turn on the motor: it has a forward direction to drive the food OUT, and a reverse setting on the toggle switch to move the food back in case of a clog. I've never needed to do this.2.

The worse job is the sieve of the cone and even that doesn't take but a moment to swab off some pulp that clings to it. I do this ASAP, as I sip my juice, because letting pulp dry on the machine makes it hard to clean. I then reassemble it right then and there, and it's ready to go again.5.

The spinning cup model (Braun) is LOUD, really loud. This is because the cup spins at a high speed and whines as a result. This is typical for the cup-type juicer. Sounds like a blender.  1.

It gives you the ability to juice and grind things the spinning cup can't handle, like wheatgrass and if you want, meat. It extracts more juice--and at the prices for produce these days, especially if you buy organic produce, this is an important benefit. The juicer is relatively easy to clean and to assemble and use. If you are really serious about drinking vegetable juice or making fresh fruit juices and baby foods, I would say, this is a model to strongly consider over others. The performance and added functionality well repay the higher price
 Perhaps like you, I love silicone.  You can do anything with silicone.  You can fry, poach, make soups, and there is never a worry about heat.  Le Crueset makes fine quality silicone utensils, but their wood is unfinished, so unless you keep them oiled, they will age and spilter.  These you can remove the top if you like but the wooden handles are treated, and are water resistant.  Perhaps like you, I love silicone.  You can do anything with silicone.

I like that the shape is slightly angled, this makes it easier to run along the edges of a bowl.  I  have been so happy with my purchase of these!  I can't say enough good things about them.  I would recommend these over other manufactors, they are better made, and improve in others weaker areas.  A must have for your kitchen
 Love the functionality - being able to separate for different uses esp. meat and that they flex to enable direct frop into the pan. But mine came off color (sorta transparent) at the corners (and this wasn't a deisgn feaure since there was no pattern in all the four sheets) but still good value - not worth exchanging so I kept them. I guess mine look unique
 I've had 2 sets of these simple but marvelous mats so far, not only the handiest thing I've bought for my kitchen, but friends keep talking me into giving them one. I only need one or two but one is always on my countertop for various uses the past few years.I've had 2 sets of these simple but marvelous mats so far, not only the handiest thing I've bought for my kitchen, but friends keep talking me into giving them one.

Mainly love the ease of chopping or slicing vegies on it, folding it over like a funnel and dumping right into a salad bowl or a pan with NO SPILLS, or vegies onto another can't do without item, faithful George Foreman Grill, beside my meat entree.

Top down, vegies and meat dinner in 4 minutes.So simple to just put under the faucet and run hot water over it, or wipe with a little bleach on a sponge. Very few knife marks on mine, but I don't like super sharp knives, and if I seldom have to cut meat I use a scissors and wax paper on the mat to then wrap and freeze pieces. I buy boneless skinless chicken or pork or sirloin chops. The grill gets a once over with a damp paper towel. So simple and time saver, not like cuts on a wooden board which is most unsanitary.

Beyond a slicing surface, great for placing cannisters on to fill with coffee or sugar, salt shakers, or stuff I seem to always have to spill some, shakey hands at 70. Just roll it up, shake in the trash or sink disposal, rinse if necessary and reuse, keeps counter clean and free of stains. I put hot or cold things on it to protect the formica, made a few stains with coffee but cleans with bleach ok, not ruining my counter top. They wear well but at the price, and the work they save they can be tossed for another new one. Best features are flexible enough to roll and empty, easy cleanup forget the broom, and no storage problem in my cramped space - stack them on the counter and peel top one off for next job.Beyond a slicing surface, great for placing cannisters on to fill with coffee or sugar, salt shakers, or stuff I seem to always have to spill some, shakey hands at 70.

So glad to see these are on the web, had a hard time finding more in stores when I want to gift someone. If you want the job done clean and fast, tired of bending picking up rollaway strays off the floor (or always between stove and counter narrow space) buy these for a staple in a kitchen, especially for seniors - I've no dishwasher nor disposal I might add. Why in the world would one need a cutting board heat resistant? not for oven or stovetop use. For glue guns and crafts which I also do, put a piece of wax paper over your extra mat if you want to protect a table top, I use one on my desk and serves as a coaster too. I didn't even know about the silicone part, who cares. So glad to see these are on the web, had a hard time finding more in stores when I want to gift someone.

 Looks good  Works even better Nice storage case for attachment
 I've had this processor for about three months. On the first day, I decided to make bread, and the dough blade suddenly stuck to the machine. When I called customer service to help me figure out what I did wrong, they told me that occasionally, this processor's dough blade fuses to the machine. I couldn't even get the containers removed to pack up because everything was stuck together. Fortunately, the customer service rep was really nice and sent out a new one immediately. I received my second new processor, and tried to make cookies. This time, everything worked fine, and the machine is quiet. I can even talk on the phone when using this food processor. I'm just glad that they exchanged the first one so quickly
 nay more than just a jar catcher, use it to scramble egges. with cheese etc...............
 The solid contruction and well machined lids make these a joy to use.  We didn't want high maint. type of cookware just a high quality, easy to use and maintain product that looks good on the pot racks but cooks well every day.  Boy we are impressed! These cook with even heat and the only negative found was that the lids fit so well you have remember to take them off befor the dish cools or a vacume can form inside requiring reheat to remove the lid. They are easy to clean and a dream to handle
 This monstrous beast is the largest piece of cookware that we own.  Once I manage to wrangle it out from the cupboard and heft it onto the stove, it's many uses range from cooking chickens, small turkeys, and roasts to making potato leek soup.  The beautiful thing is that it really retains heat and cooks items thoroughly and evenly.  The downside is that it can take a while to heat up, especially since it should heat up on a med-low setting so as not to burn items and/or damage the porcelain.  Learned this the hard way by turning up my soup to med-hi in order to get it boiling more quickly (doh!).  Now that we know how to properly use this type of cookware, we are enjoying it much more!  Another clever use of this piece is to incorporate it into your weight lifting routine (did I mention this thing is very VERY heavy?).  Now that we have tried the largest, we have begun collecting some of the smaller pots and really enjoying them
 So cliche...but I am forced to learn this lesson OVER & OVER.  I thought to myself $100 for a rice cooker, and bought a $20 one in Chinatown.  It gave me nothing but trouble...Soggy rice, sometimes burned at the bottom, et cetera...So cliche...but I am forced to learn this lesson OVER & OVER.

 This is the best hot air corn popper I've ever had.  I can count on one hand the unpopped kernels in a batch.  Highly recommended
 I have never had a popcorn maker before and I LOVE it!  I didn't think that it would be any different but its great!  It so much healthier since there is no oil used.  It is fast and not messy at all.  Its cheaper in the long run to becasue a small amount goes a long way.  You can buy a large jar of popcorn for about $5 and its makes ALOT!The only reason I gave it a 4 is becasue I vought this particular one due to the butter melter.  Even when I use soft butter it does not melt all they way.  I just melt it in the microwave while its popping.  NOt a big deal though, I'd buy this maker again
 It works great, it's healthier than microwave popcorn, and in the long run it's cheaper too. Pour in half a cup of kernels, plug it in, and within a couple minutes you've got a bowl full of fresh popcorn with only a few unpopped kernels and virtually no cleanup. It's not much louder than most microwave ovens and it's far less likely to burn the popcorn. Only one minor complaint: butter doesn't really melt completely in the cup on top (make sure you have melted butter ready to go if you want it). An on/off switch might've been nice but that's not a big deal unless you want to keep it on your countertop permanently. Oh and this product is identical to the Presto PopLite (ASIN: B00006IUWA) just with a different label (it even says so in the description above), but you get a coupon for 50 cents off Orville's with this one
 There are all kinds of similar products that claim to be heat resistant to this or that temp. All I can say is these Spatulas are the real deal when it comes to heat resistance and at a great price. I only wish there were a 3rd somewhat smaller blade. However, you can't go wrong with these first two sizes.
 I was originally looking for silk sheets but not the silk sheet price tag.  I'm SO glad I bought these sheets instead.  They are comfy, warm and very smooth to the touch.  They fit my 14" mattress with ease.  I've had them about 2 months now and there are only a few drawbacks that I've noticed... they take _forever_ to dry in my dryer and they might need ironing once dry'ish.  Overall, not worth 600 but if you can catch them on sale you'll be very pleased with the results
 My husband has allergies to cat dander, and we have 4 indoor cats. We finally broke down and paid $500+ for this vacuum and replaced our old bag vacuum. I must say, this thing is AMAZING! I cannot say enough good things about this vacuum. The first time we used it in our living room, we emptied the canister 3 times! And I had just vacuumed with my old vacuum the day before.. It is amazing what this machine picks up that other vacuums leave behind. I could find no flaws with this product, other than it would be nice if it were cheaper. :
 Although I love the patterns and heft of my 2 collections of stoneware, I got very tired of having them chipped and broken by the less "careful" members of my family. Although I've had two sets of Corelle before, and never had any problems with it, I never saw patterns that I could live with for very long. I've gone back to Corelle, and I think this is it for me. True, the plates are very light, but they are so damage resistant--and I can use this pattern for any season
 You could almost use these incredibly practical and beautiful dishes in place of fine china. However, if you look too closely at the ivy print, you'll notice that the "ink dots" are rather large... more like a coarse newspaper photo print than the printed pictures in most magazines. If only they had printed these with higher quality..
 I've had this knife for years, use it for everything and couldn't be happier.  I thought it would dull easily or wear down, after all it's only $10, but I was wrong.  Simply fantastic for cutting bread, but also useful for vegetables and other tasks.  The only thing it doesn't cut well is meat
 I LOVE THIS BREADMAKER! IT IS SO EASY TO USE AND MAKES DELICIOUS LOAVES OF BREAD. IT DOESN'T TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE IN THE KITCHEN AND ALL OF MY ROOMMATES LOVE USING IT TOO. SUPER AWESOME
 I purchased this for my Mom.  Her main criteria being a large size kettle.  She reports that she "Loves it" and that it heats up very quickly
 These cup are enormous! (Not to mention beautiful, in that fun and elegant way that only Fiestaware can be.) I was looking for a very large, oversized mug because I drink a lot of coffee and tea and am sick of having to refill constantly. I definately got my wish. I have eaten soup and cereal out of these, I even used them to serve coffee ice cream recently. Very cute! I plan on getting them in all of the six colors I have in Fiestaware. Let me tell you again, this cup is HUGE
 I received a blue set for Christmas and I love them. The stay cool handles really stay cool, even if you are cooking something for a long time. They are beautiful and  Iloev the way they feel. My Caphalon pans are now collecting dust in the back of the cupboard becuase I like these so much more
 The Farberware Millennium Soft Touch Stainless-Steel 12-Inch Nonstick Skillet is great for almost any cooking.
 I am so in love with my new machine.  Many thanks to all the reviewers who made my long search for the perfect espresso machine become a reality.  I received my machine really quickly and that's saying something for someone who loves immediate gratification.  Speaking of gratification, I could not be happier with my choice of an automatic espresso machine.  All the reviews are true. It's perfect, once you read the instructions or perhaps do as I did, get a walk-thru from the wonderful folks at DeLonghi customer support, you will be up and running in no time.  You can see that the machine is solidly constructed and with proper care (read the instructions) will last a very long time.  The espressos I've made so far are supreme, even my 14 year old loved a weak one I made for him; and it's so easy after set-up to use.  It could not be any simpler.  Who would not love this machine?  There was one website that was charging $1200 for the same machine.  I could not believe my eyes.  The only review that troubled me was the one who said the frother was somehow not adequate due to it not swinging far enough away from the machine.  I really could not see what he was talking about.  It has plenty of room for any size cup but you have to remember if you are into the foam (it makes very creamy foam) it will increase the volume 2-3 times so you need a large enough container to froth the milk.  But there was no awkwardness or problem at all with using the frother.  They had me worried when I read that but the frother does its thing with total ease.  Even a caveman could do it.  You stick it in the milk and turn the switch and, voila!, it's frothed and container size is only an issue if you are trying to froth in something too small and can't accomodate the foam it creates.  All in All, this is a top notch buy and a guilty pleasure for sure and nothing could be more gratifying then having merchandise that lives up to its promise.  This machine delivers, I love it and so will you
 Great item! I have looked for something like this to use in non-stick cookware so as not to scratch.  It is finally here!!  I have used it several times.  It is a great product.  I even bought one for my sister too!  I love it and I am sure you will too
 This tabletop fan is a telling reason why Vornado has been around for a long time.  Great air output, high quality, well-built, very quiet on low speed, adjustable so you can tilt it at any angle you want, and just small enough to fit on your desk, table, or in our case, the bathroom counter.  My wife uses this fan to cool off in the bathroom while getting ready in the morning, and it really does the job.  It has a very focused air flow so she can aim it on herself without bothering me.  It's very smooth running, so there's no danger of it vibrating off the counter.  It costs a bit more than the typical portable fan, but then there's nothing more frustrating than having a fan that won't cool you off.  No worries with this one!  The extra money is well spent here.  This fan lives up to the saying, "You get what you pay for"
 We originally bought the product for our toddler's room and then ended up buying a second Vornado for our master bedroom.  This is an excellent buy for several reasons. First, it is sleek and stylish, especially given its neutral color.  Second, it provides a great wind speed given its small size.  Third, it provides a constant soothing wind sound, which is great for drowning out any annoying pheripheral noises.  Lastly, I have not seen the product in a retail store any cheaper than on Amazon.com.  We have had the product over 8 months with nightly use with no sign of defficiency in performance
 Reliable and functions.  Much less expensive than "ionic breeze" or other yuppie products one might get at the S.I. Has three fan settings and is very quiet.  Doesn't stir up dust and blow it around like a traditional fan does.  Only draw back is that it does not have a filter. 
 This is SUCH a great deal here on amazon.  I paid more than this at an outlet!  But, that said, this is a gorgeous butter dish and a beautiful addition to your holiday table.  I use mine throughout the holidays and winter, it is just so very pretty and does a great job on keeping butter fresh.  Plus, it's VERY easy to clean (don't you love scraping those butter pieces off?) by just popping it on the top shelf of a dishwasher.  Mine has been used for 12 years and still looks new. 
 This is a very comfortable bowl to use.  Made of sturdy plastic, it is much lighter than glass mixing bowls, which makes it convenient and easy to use. The handle is very ergonomic and comfortable to grip (really good when pouring batter into a pan, for instance), and the shape of the bowl itself is perfect for wrapping an arm around for those heavy duty mixing sessions.  The rubber on the bottom keeps the bowl right where you put it - no sliding.  I use this bowl the most of all my mixing bowls and am looking forward to getting a bigger one just like it. Oh, by the way - it's dishwasher safe, too. I've washed mine over and over and it still looks new
 I didn't think it would be that large either but i got used to them after a while.  you need a tall container to hold them in though.  They are of good quality finally NO MELTING! great to use with my ionized cookware which makes a smooth cooking combination
 I ordered this the early part of December, so had it in time for the Christmas season.  I am so very pleasantly surprised about the power and efficiency of this one.  It is small so storage is a breeze, and the capacity of the bowl is just right for any chopping, etc. that you need to do.  This is my &quot;new favorite&quot; appliance
 This food chopper is my favorite extra appliance in the kitchen.  For salsas, the low speed lets me keep the ingredients chunky. For sauces, the higher speed can easily puree most ingredients. My favorite item to use it for is onions and it saves alot of tears.  The large bowl not only holds alot, but is also very  easy to clean. I highly recommend this food chopper for frequent or casual dicing cook
 These are extremely well-designed and will be the hit of your party!  I have used these twice at small gatherings and each person who had a martini commented about how great they were and asked where I bought them.  They are easy to clean and easy to store.  I highly recommend them. These are extremely well-designed and will be the hit of your party!

 I was thinking of buying parchment paper before this product caught my eyes.   I took a chance after reviewing others' good reviews on it.  And it was a good buy.  I used it to bake and it's totally non-stick.  It's also very easy to clean after use.  If it can be used 5000 times as it claims, I definitely will save a lot compared to buying parchment paper
 I have the tangerine one and I love it --  it's great for using in the microwave to make Rice a Roni and stuff like that.  However, my father ordered the Periwinkle one off of my wish list and it kept getting backordered --  for months.  We finally cancelled the order and I got something else from my wish list
 this product offers a phenomenon deal a steal for the asking price
 These are thin, lightweight, flexible mats that are great for chopping things on and then picking up and folding up the edges to pour the food into a pot/pan. This thinness/flexibility has a "downside" too: I do agree with the other reviewers that these mats tend to curl up and not lay flat.  However,they clean up easily, the price is right, and I am happy with my purchase.
 I've used these for months to protect tile countertops and they basically work except they start bending after a while on the edges and something light (like an empty glass)tends to fall over.  They are heavy duty and I put hot items on them with no problems
 So glad I bought this turner! It's very flexible and I can get under and flip my omelette/pancake beautifully. I love how I can now scrape the pan clean (as hard as I want) without leaving any scratches. It's very easy to clean too. 
 This peeler is amazing, and really inexpensive. I am really please with how easily it takes the skin off of cucumbers, carrots, etc. This is definetly a great item
 After suffering for years with blade grinders and cheaper burr grinders, I decided to take the plunge and get the Capresso Infinity in brushed chrome. This grinder addresses all the problems I had with the lesser machines: it's fairly quiet, free of static, grinds evenly, and is easy to clean (although unless you use really oily beans, you shouldn't need to clean it very often).

The chrome versions have a "zinc die-cast housing," weigh almost twice as much as the ABS plastic version, and are very stable.Just a note on its construction: the difference between the chrome versions and the ABS plastic version is more than just the finish or a metal skin.

The list price on the manufacturer's website is $139.99, not $190. I got mine locally at Sur la Table
 I was helped in choosing this pizza stone by the hundreds of online reviews and suggestions posted by people from all over. Well, they were all right. Excellent item. I bought two stones and used them simultaneously for the first two homemade pizzas of my life... DELICIOUS! As others have suggested, I never remove the stone from the oven, and lately I just placed a pan containing the dough for an olive focaccia and it came out perfectly done. I am convinced that the stone works its magic also when not used to bake directly on it. I am extremely happy so far and I'd highly recommend this item. Buon Appetito
 I can't believe how fast I received my pizza stone and the way it was packaged was great.  I've use pizza stones before and loved the way they even out the heat in the oven and the cripy crust that it gives.  I'll very happy with my purchase
 and i like my cupcakes with frosting still on them
 These are excellent!  Instead of reaching for a paper towel, I grab one of these (choosing a size that completely covers the top of the item I am microwaving), and then wash it when finished.  I did notice that the smooth side should be on top to prevent it from curling up when it gets hot.  I really like the fact that you can see through it since I couldn't see through paper towels
 This is what I use when making a roux and when I need to break up ground meat while cooking.  It's nice and heavy and feels good in my hand. I have cheaper wooden products and they don't hold up as well as this does.  You can tell the difference between OXO wooden utensils and others because of the quality.  I think you can put it in the dishwasher but I never do. I hand wash it and oil it whenever I oil my cutting board.   I love its rich color.  It's a great product
 I wanted to say that this is the Best Cleaner out there as far as Im concerned.Very Easy to Assemble, and Use. Our carpet came out looking like new, all the stains that I have been trying to get out came out with no problem at all.We bought a model home for custom built homes and there was alot of heavy traffic (foot) in the house not to mention we have pets in the house.I used the cleaner all through the house (2200 sq ft).

 My wife and I have long been fans of Fiestaware and we have been using many of their pieces for years. Somehow it wasn't until about 2 years ago that we discovered this size.

 I think this cover is just perfect for the price and easy zipper closure!  The other reviewers must not have read the description closely because it does say COVER!  A featherbed is a featherbed, this says featherbed cover!  Easy to take off, easy to wash, and easy to put back on

 I just got it today and can't wait to cook something in it. It is very good looking, larger than I expected and very deep. I will be cooking everything in it from now on
 To prevent scratches and chipping and to retain Fiesta's smooth glossy surface, hand wash separately, one piece at a time, in a soft rubber dishpan and stack between paperplates (cups between coffee filters).  I do this with all my stoneware and pieces 30 years old still look like new. A friend gave me all her brown dripware (Gourmet) from 1969 and the place settings are scratched, pitted and dull from stacking and years of automatic dishwashing.  Mine from the same era are still glossy, mostly scratch free, and certainly not pitted. Also, I don't put my original pieces in my microwave, (only hers) because although it may be safe to do so, this can dull a glossy finish.  Re Fiestaware, I remember seeing relatives and neighbors Fiesta cups & plates with chips and always thought them very unattractive and "cheap"- looking, perhaps because of the dull rose, gray, and avacado colors at the time. However,I find most of the colors presently available very bright and pretty and,so far, have bought Heather,Seamist, Scarlett, Tangerine, Turquoise, and yellow. Cobalt, Cinnebar, and Plum are just too dark and dreary for me.  In the store, they are much darker than they look on here. In a library book on fiestaware, they show an earlier cobalt or deep blue color that is very pretty and a real plum color (like the fruit) would be bright/pretty, too.
 This is a great set of dinnerware!! After 25 years, my husband and I decided to bring some color into our lives by replacing our wedding gift white Corelle with festive FiestaWare. How lovely to open the cabinets and see color!!! We've mixed colors and have an eight piece display of color. FiestaWare is not only beautiful, but durable.  And it can be put in the dishwasher, microwave, oven and freezer!!! It may cost a bit more than some of the trendy stuff available, but it's adaptability to all uses makes it a fabulous value!!! If you are at all tempted by it --- BUY IT!!!! You will LOVE it! Put some color in your life
 I have never had any problems using this pan.  The key is to use a recipe for French bread or baguettes, not just any bread recipe.  I use a bread machine dough cycle to prepare the dough, because I'm just not talented at breadmaking.  The French bread recipe in the machine's owner's manual worked fine, and so did a French bread recipe in a bread machine cookbook.  I think other doughs are too soft and get into the holes, as other reviewers have noted.  They didn't prepare the right kind of bread dough.I have never had any problems using this pan.

LOL  The Chicago Metallic baguette pan is easy to use and results in a crusty, chewy bread.  Lovely
 I received this knife as a Christmas present and so far, I am pleased. What struck me first about this knife is how wonderfully sharp it is. I also own a Wusthoff Santoku (which I love, too) and this knife was just as sharp right out of the box as the Wusthoff was. It is rather comfortable in the hand and the shape of the blade allows for very smooth rocking and chopping action, which is wonderful when you are chopping vegetables. It is also wonderful for carving meats, with its long sharp blade. The blade is a little on the thin side for my tastes, however, but is certainly functional. The grip is also slightly larger than I would like, making it a bit more cumbersome to hold than my Wusthoff. But these matters are not that important considering the price of this knife. If price were not an issue and I had to choose between a Wusthoff and a Forschner Fibrox, then I would probably choose a Wusthoff. But being that a Wusthoff of this size would be at least $50 more, then price does come to play. If money is no object, then choose the wonderful German steel of a Wusthoff or look into the Japanese steel of a Shun. But if you are like most of us and have to consider price, then I do believe you will be happy with a Forschner Fibrox Chef's Knife.
 Yes, the Le Creuset spatulas are wonderful. They look great and are very, very useful. Throw away your old rubber ones which melt and buy one of these. You will never regret it
 I have a small kitchen, will always have a small kitchen, and finding a place to store my cookware was a problem. I purchased the Calphalon wall rack and hubby installed it. Installation was easy and the rack looks so nice againist my kitchen wall. My pots are now safely organized and my kitchen has more storage space. I wish I had enough room for a second rack..
  I've used a pair of Emperor 400 filters on a 75 gallon tank continuously for the past five years or so. So far, neither has needed attention other than filter changes and recently, new impellers. After five years, the constantly spinning impellers had worn their shafts and bushings to the point where they made a rattley noise, although they still moved water effectively. Replacing the impellers was an easy repair, and restored the unit to almost total silence. The filter may actually now be quieter than when it was new, as there appeared to be a slight design change in the new impellers when compared to the old ones.

I'm still using the original biowheels, with no end in sight. For almost anyone, a single Emperor would provide adequate filtration, however at the time I purchased them, I had seven huge goldfish in the tank, who produced vast quantities of waste matter. Eventually the goldfish grew too large for the tank and were relocated to a pond in the backyard, and the tank was restocked with a variety of colorful tropical fish.I'm still using the original biowheels, with no end in sight.

Eventually the goldfish grew too large for the tank and were relocated to a pond in the backyard, and the tank was restocked with a variety of colorful tropical fish. The big selling feature for the Emperor 400 is the dual biowheels, which provides a highly oxygenated living space for beneficial bacteria to colonize. These bacteria help remove some of the waste products which the fish produce, resulting in healthier fish, and extending the time interval between water changes, and thus reducing maintainence of the aquarium. Other filters have alternative methods of providing biological filtration, but the biowheel is so effective that it can keep nitrates at an undetectable level.

Other filters have alternative methods of providing biological filtration, but the biowheel is so effective that it can keep nitrates at an undetectable level. These filters are made of a black, slightly flexible plastic which seems to be less brittle than the transparant material used on some other filters. As others have mentioned, each filter has four slots for filter cartridges. And the filter comes with two refillable media containers which can occupy two of those slots, if you choose to use them. Then can hold extra carbon, zeolite, or other material. I have mine filled with porous ceramic noodles.

The Emperor 400 has a control for water volume, so you can turn it down when feeding your fish, preventing all the food from being sucked into the filter. After the fish have finished eating, the volume can be set back to "high", however I have left it in the second slowest postion for weeks at a time, and the fish seemed to be content. I have found that if the volume control is not moved for a long time, it tends to accumulate mineral deposits and become stiff. So, I turn it down every day when feeding, then turn it back up a couple of hours later. Also, if the power is interrupted while water volume is turned down, the filter takes longer to prime itself and begin pumping properly. If power fails when volume is turned up, the filter restarts with no problem when power is restored.

The Emperor 400 comes with a cleaning brush for the spray bars and an extension for the water intake to be used if you have a very deep tank. My own tank is fairly deep, and the extension would bring the intake nearer the bottom, however I don't use the extension, and filtration seem fine.

When setting up an aquarium, it should be born in mind that the closer to a natural habitat you can get, the healthier your fish will be and the less maintainence will be required. My own tank is set up as follows: When setting up an aquarium, it should be born in mind that the closer to a natural habitat you can get, the healthier your fish will be and the less maintainence will be required. My own tank is set up as follows: Two inches of "Eco-Complete planted aquarium substrate" soil purchased in sealed bags at the local store AquariumConnection. The soil is intended for use in aquariums with live plants, which feed on some of the wastes. In the soil, there are approximately 20 Anubis plants scattered around the tank. The fish love to swim between and around the leaves, or hide behind them. From time to time, eggs are laid on the leaves of the plants. The bright green leaves stand out in vivid contrast against the nearly black soil. Two 15 watt fluorescent lights provide illumination to stimulate photsynthesis in the plants.

I strongly recommend that you do NOT use any type of gravel, colored or otherwise, as food falls down into the gravel where fish cannot reach it, and where it rots and fouls the water. If you choose to use gravel, you MUST vacuum the gravel on a weekly basis, and your water still will not be as clean. Gravel equals more work and dirtier water. Sand is better than gravel as food cannot fall down into the sand, but sand still doesn't provide nutrition for live plants. Use Eco-Complete soil or something comparable, both you and your fish will be happier.

 pretty pink and for a verry* good cause..very sturdy..just pricey but as i said..its for a good caus
 This Whisk is far superior to any other I have owned. I cook constantly and a whisk is a necessary tool. This one is sturdy, reliable, and stands up to the most viscous mixtures. Kitchenaid is the way to go for all of your appliance and cookware needs
 This steamer fits perfectly on Cuisinart's 4 Qt saucepan.  The lid seals in every bit of steam.  I used to always have to add more water when steaming batches of corn-on-the-cob, but since no steam escapes here, I can make several batches non-stop.  I also like the fact that the steamer is wide; that means that the food will cook evenly (instead of other steamers where the stuff at the bottom gets overcooked and the stuff at the very top gets undercooked).  I've only used the steamer five or six times but so far, there's practically no sign of dullness or staining - maybe just a little sign of dullness, but I'm more interested in function than appearance.  Washing it immediately will keep it stain-free.  Overall, an incredible deal for $20.00
 I'm new to bakery decorating and the tips work great!  You can use them with pastry bags or even just regular plastic bags (if you cut open a corner for the tip).  It is easy to clean with the brush and it is great that it comes with it's own box for easy storage.  There are enough tips for simple decorating, still testing out all the different sizes and options
 From the review of this CA King and the review of the King, these comforter's sizes are off only in design. I have a CA King and the CA King actually fits my bed great overall. But the problem is in the main part of the bordered pattern ends too high at the foot of the bed and the beginning of the ruffle part is also now too high up on the foot of the bed, even though the whole thing still fits overall. If I pull the comforter down so that the ruffle part starts at the foot of my bed, it hangs a little low and I have about 10 inches at the head of my bed uncovered.The comforter is absolutely gorgeous and seems to be quality made. I will fill that 10" space with lots of pillows because $60 is an absolute steal!
 Two of the basic kitchen specialty items included in one package deal!  Easy grip handles, stylish and quality design will assure that these items will be around in my array of often used gadgets for a long time to come
 I really like this set.  The blue is very pretty and the tools are all very high quality
 I have spent thousands of dollar's, On Meyers cookware everthing from KitchenAid, Anolon, Prestige, Faberware, &amp; Circulan, just to name a few. Though Meyers does manufacture very high quality pots &amp; pans and I would recommend them to anyone it's just sad that if you have any problem with them, under warranty, you have to go throught the chain of command, that never gets you anywhere, even if you want to speak with upper management about the rudeness of the customer service department. Their customer service department employees are always very rude and snotty and they act like they are doing you a favor to even talk to you about their products. Don't get me wrong they do make good cookware, probably the best, but you as the consumer are at the mercy of their customer service and their descision or your fait on wheather your life time warranty is honored or not
 Excellent. Was a replacement iron for a different brand I dropped after over ten years service. Features have improved
 This takes a little practice to get used to putting the opener properly on the can. However, once you do, it works extremely well- it turns smoothly and cans are opened cleanly, regardless of can size. I especially like having no sharp edges
 I ordered one of these, after seeing someone use a similar grill pan on a cooking show.  When I received the product, it was superior in quality.  Very heavy and extremely attractive.  I couldn't wait to use it.  I just wanted to get those little grill marks on my food, because I don't own an outdoor grill and I don't like the idea of dealing with mosquitos while grilling outside.  Not only did I get the marks, but I got the burnt grill flavor on my chicken breast, too.   The first night that I used it, I was having a dinner party while cooking.  It performed stellar on the first use.  I used chicken breast strips and noticed that though they seared with that great sound, they were cooking evenly and slowly.  The food didn't burn, but I had to cook it a long time to get the chicken thoroughly done.  The taste was perfect and not burnt or dry at all.  I was so excited that I cooked whole bonely breast two days later and can't wait to grill the shrimp and vegetables this weekend.  Beware though, the thickness of the meat will cause a lengthy grilling time.  So, the house will be full of smoke (for the inexperienced cook like me), but the meat will not burn or dry out.  I also purchased the heart shape pot which was great for display of the casserole but the grill pan has me walking on cloud nine.  Matter of fact, I'm eating grilled chicken for lunch right now and it taste great!
 This is a great timer for the price, a little bulky though. It's nice to be able to set the timer for seconds, minutes or hours and also be able to count down or upwards. I'll use it as a reminder for appointments while I'm working in the office at home as well as in the kitchen. This will also be handy for soccer practice
 This is the knife you need to slice your bread.  I wondered why my old knife and new breadmaker didn't get along.  This knife solved the problem.  You get nice, clean, even slices of bread with this knife.  For me, it is the nicest thing to happen to make even, sliced bread, a reality in my kitchen
 This ice cream scoop recieved a great review in a cooking magazine so I bought it and love it
 Does what it is supposed to.  But go to Yahoo FoodSaver Group for lots of hints on how to make it work as well as it can
 I love this coffee pot!  It makes a great pot of coffee, keeps it hot to that last cup, cleans like a champ and looks fabulous all at the same time!!  I highly recommend this item.  A french press makes the best coffee and I'll never have to worry about breaking another glass carafe
 My Joyce Chen bowls arrived perfectly packed and in excellent shape.  The individual boxes themselves were sturdy and have extra cushioning inside, spoon and chopsticks were wrapped separately.   My son is addicted to Ramen Noodles and serving them in these bowls takes it up a notch.  I love the chopsticks that come with the set.  They have  grooves at the tip that serve to hold slippery noodle better than anything I have ever seen. These noodle bowls make a 15 cent meal look so special and I wouldn't hesitate to order more as gifts
 The first thing I noticed about this is just how good it looks.  It really is a showpiece in my kitchen.  The smooth, rounded shape and the shiny chrome finish really make it look fabulous and I leave it out on the counter all the time.  Apart from that, it seems pretty much a normal toaster.  The extra-lift feature makes getting small bagels out very easy, and the electronic buttons are handy too.  I like the way it can take four big pieces of bread or bagels without taking up too much room in the kitchen.  5 stars
 I just keep buying more of these glasses, including other sizes and shapes. They look good and are great at keeping drinks hot or cold
 "I think It's cleaning itself" says my wife as she was soaking it in the sink after we baked mac and cheese. It seemed like it was. I gave it a quick scrub with a songe and it was clean. No need to soak it really. "I think It's cleaning itself" says my wife as she was soaking it in the sink after we baked mac and cheese. It seemed like it was.

 I have the four piece set of these silicone utensils, and have been very pleased with them.  They are heat resistant, heavy-duty, and look sharp.   They are slightly flexible, but I have not found this to be a problem unless you want to do heavy scraping with the turner.   The best part is the wonderful easy-clean properties of the silicone.   My other heat-resistant utensils always look icky and need to be scrubbed with a scouring pad to clean the textured finish.   These look great right out of the dishwasher!   I've had them for a year and they've held up great.   The turner has not disintegrated on the edge, either, like many other types do.  The smooth finish allows food to slip right off without sticking as you're cooking
 This is a nice sturdy wooden knife block with plenty of slots
 I have used this filter with my Grind-n-Brew for 2 years. I put it in the dishwasher at least twice and have never had any problems with it. I have no idea what these other reviewers are doing wrong, but I love this filter. I never have grounds in my coffee. There is always a little darker/thicker coffee in the bottom of a good cup of coffee!I have used this filter with my Grind-n-Brew for 2 years.

 Love this cake plate. Looks like our retro 50s kitchen. Its solid, well-formed glass with fluting on the base, a nice touch. And you can't beat the price. Our dinner guests are always excited about desert when they see it displayed so adoringly. I can't think of a single thing bad about it. Well, maybe the cleaning part
 I've enjoyed mine for 15 years, my mom has enjoyed hers for 36 years, not sure how old my grandma's is, all still run great. Mixes breads, cookies, cakes, pancakes, hamburger and whips cream and egg whites effortlessly. Easy to clean. Some reviews have commented on the weight, my mom has had arthritis for a long time, and she still uses this all the time. Just leave it on your counter, it looks great and you're going to uses it every other day anyway. It is getting to be our standard wedding present and we have never had any complaints. Just feels good to have something so beautiful, reliable, well made and useful sitting handy on the counter
 I have 4 of these cookie sheets, and am ordering more.  I bake in quantity, and these sheets are the only ones I've found that don't warp when heated, and that come clean without intense effort.  They also maintain a very consistent heat, so that all the cookies on the sheet brown at the same time. 
 This is a really nice cookie sheet. I baked cookies soon after I received this cookie sheet, and they were great! I plan to order another so that I have 2 on hand. I am tired of the nonstick pans that scratch and then rust easily. This is a nice alternative
 I just bought this piece and tried it out. I love the size and no drip mouth..The color is beautiful and its so pretty on my buffet
 I have not purchased a ripe pineapple due to the fact that it is so difficult to hand peel. So I have gone without this delicious fruit for too long. I happened on the slicer while browsing amazon and could not believe they had such a tool! I ordered it right then and it arrived in a few days. All that was said about it is really true! It cuts a pineapple in a matter of seconds leaving a very attractive bowel, the pinapple it self
 Hi,We got this set one month after getting married, and guess what, it is the thing that we always wanted. It gives us the choices in pan sizes. and there are three more mixing bowls which come handy while cooking or storing left overs. The stockpots are wonderful, they are the used  most of the times. The mirror polish is still intact, I think this is a wonderful thing that a newly wed should  have. Its worth the price.We got this set one month after getting married, and guess what, it is the thing that we always wanted.

 This coffee maker is the best I have ever used.  It keeps the coffee hot for 2 hours or more after brewing and it is easy to clean and maintain.  I would recommend this appliance to anyone.
 I like this product. Quality is very good.  I use it for other things besides marinating.  Store homemade cookies in it, left over soups and stews, etc.  I am glad I bought it.
 Emile Henri has a superb line of table ware and these coffe mugs are no exception.  Brilliantly hued and durable. 
 I love products that are genuinely high quality goods.  This fan comes under that category.I love products that are genuinely high quality goods.  This fan comes under that category.If you are looking to purchase a fan, I can recommend this one
 I agree with most of the positive reviews of the VacuVin Food Saver set. However, I'd love a larger size--one that could hold at least one pound of ground coffee. I suppose the downside would be that it would take longer to pump the air out of a larger container. But, they're easy to use, look nice, and keep the food fresher longer.

 This was my first 'nice' knife when I was taken in by the Santoku craze, and it was certainly a decent choice.  The knife is sharp out of the box, reasonably well balanced, and has pretty good fit/finish.  For the type of person who only buys things like veggies and boneless/skinless chicken, etc., that are largely prepared, this knife will probably fit the bill and allow you finish up small amounts of prep work.  The real drawback is the length.  When you live in the South, you see vidalia onions that are 7" in diameter.  This knife is a bit small to tackle the large veggies.  And don't even think about getting it near hard melons or bone-in meats.  Since I got this knife, I've expanded my collection quite a bit, even adding some real Japanese steel.  But this little blade keeps a spot on my magnetic strip, where it comes out for small tasks or when my wife can't get me to relinquish the big blade.  For most cooks, who need a real omni-tasker knife, I would look for a 9-10" chef's knife rather than this. 
 This listing fails to mention that these dishes are from the Ultra line which are significantly thicker and heavier than just the normal square dishes Corelle has recently released.  This is fabulous because I was concerned that the old Corelle I remember is a bit thin. These carry a 5-year warranty vs. the regular 3-yr.This listing fails to mention that these dishes are from the Ultra line which are significantly thicker and heavier than just the normal square dishes Corelle has recently released.

These carry a 5-year warranty vs. the regular 3-yr.This pattern is more beautiful in person; the leaves have a great texture to them. The pattern is softer and less "limey" in person (in a good way). Don't shy away from Corelle because they aren't known for style (I almost did). The durability and beauty of these dishes are unmatched in my opinion.  Purchased two sets for special occassion dinners and everyday use
 The silverware is extremely nice - compared to other I bought elsewhere.  They are polished for a nice feel, and combined with the weight, this makes for pleasure while eating.  Also, saving more than 50% from the original price is awesome!!  :
 This cooking/serving stainless steel slotted spoon, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure-absorbing, non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you'll prefer this product to the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries.Its elegant, stylized shape makes it perfect to use either in the kitchen or at the dinner table, and it also comes with an oversized hole at the tip of the handle for easy hanging, and a strong, stout neck guaranteed to be unbendable.Overall, this spoon is perfect to strain vegetables, fruits, shrimp and other foods, and its easy to clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hardwearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years. Furthermore, its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away. After submitting this product to over three years of normal, everyday use, mine is still just like new.--Reviewed by Maritza Volma
 I love the toaster oven.  I used it about every day.  Strongly recommend this to buyers.
 If you want to pay over $100 you can find much better quality, but for 70% less this is a fantastic value
 This is THE bowl that we were looking for. We found it at several places, but Amazon.com had the best price. They even beat the local &quot;discount&quot; cooking stor
 After 3 years, and oddly enough three different replacement robots, the battery finally lost its ability to charge.  Being a product that has one model made by one manufacturer, I was very surprised to find the battery at a significantly lower price at Amazon. The product works as one would expect, it charged right up and it runs my Roomba, as long as it doesn't blow up like a laptop battery, I will continue to enjoy a product that makes my life a little easier. Now if they could come up with a robot that washes and folds laundry, now that would be a "must have" product
 This spatula makes frosting simple to complex cakes very easy.  Works well with many different icings
 i bought this little percolator in order to brew the homemade coffee my grandma gave me.  it works great.  perfect size, easy to use and easy on the eyes.  for the beginners (like me) it does take a couple of trial runs to get the perfect cup of coffee (a measuring spoon would have been nice).  but it's all well worth it to get a break from starbucks
 I love the quality and softness of this product.  The Sheet set fit perfectly on my bed.  And the price is unbeatabl
 It isn't at all like what I expected.  It is a very dense Jersey (knit) and keeps shape while stretching over an 18" mattress
 These glasses are superb in quality and appearance. The purchaser should be aware that they are of the smaller type of martini glass, more the original size, rather than the wide mouth styles you see in some stores today
 This is a wonderfully efficient zesting tool. If you find that you need a zester more than even once a year you should invest in this nifty little product. It boasts solid construction with an easy grip rubberized handle and 5 sharp holes for quick and easy zesting. Very easy to hold and twist when zesting. It even has a little channel knife if you want to do some fancy peeling. This beats the heck out of trying to zest with a cheap grater type device and is vastly superior to trying to zest with the edge of a knife. (As I did for years before I learned better) I use lemon and lime zest quite a bit more than the average person and I see no signs that this tool will dull, break, or wear out anytime soon. Highly recommended tool for any active zester. As easy to wash as a fork. Cool
 These are hefty, and not super soft but high quality. No fancy stitching or detail of any kind. Ran a little small for my king bed, but you can't beat the price.
 This is a premier baking sheet at a fraction of the cost.  Made of commercial grade materials, it delivers quality nearly every time.   I have made many different foods on these sheets, including fish sticks, cookies, meats and roasted potatoes.  It works great with everyone, and there is no transfer ever.  Browning is even and consistent, and I personally haven't yet had one warp at high temps and I have 4 of them.  This is a premier baking sheet at a fraction of the cost.

Not really Chicago Metallic's fault, just something to watch out for
 Wish I'd had this pan years ago - it would have saved me at least a year in clean up time! Nothing sticks to the pan! It cooks beautifully & is well worth the price. With a lifetime warranty, super easy clean up, and utensil "safe", it is a great investment! If I cooked more often, I would buy the larger Swiss Diamond also.
 This (Rose Fiestaware) sugar and creamer set is very beautiful - true to all of the fiestaware pieces.  This set goes very nicely with the large fiestaware teapot -- a wonderful gift for anyone and durable, pretty and cheerful to use for your own family. The availability was great and the speed of delivery was wonderful -- Amazon does an outstanding job as usual of customer service!  All of the Amazon staff are polite, helpful, and efficient.

It's a very nice looking pan that stays nice looking.My only criticism of it is the lack of a non-stick interior.  You either will want to line the pan with foil before cooking anything that will generate a mess or where juices might burn, or you'll have to let it soak with a dryer sheet for a while afterwards.  The stainless doesn't retain messes so much as it just takes a bit of effort to get it completely clean.

 This roasting pan is a prize and well worth the investment. It is heavy duty and I have used it for large rib roasts and a turkey.  It is wonderful for making gravy on my gas stove after roasting; the rack is so sturdy it holds any roast I could fit in my oven.  It washes clean with little effort so I have not had to use the dishwasher.  It looks like new after washing.  This pan will be around a lot longer than I will! 
 As advertised, and described in various reviews, the blender is solid, powerful and loud....very loud. I have to block my ears when it's running but I had expected that so I'm not complaining.   My one complaint is that the "water tight" lid is not and if I fill it up too full liquid comes out the top.As advertised, and described in various reviews, the blender is solid, powerful and loud....very loud.

 I am a great cook but not a good bread baker. This machine is a joy, a godsend, I love it. Easy to use, easy to clean and it never fails. Buy it now-you won't be sorry. I had 2 different breadmakers before this one-they shall remain nameless-just buy this one. I have had mine for 2 years this Christmas-what fun I have had with it
 We had the original Hamilton Beach brewmaster and loved it.  We like this one even better, although it takes longer for the coffee to brew.  I don't think I could ever go back to a regular coffee maker.
 I love this coffeepot.  I had the older version and had a problem with the timing light but so far this works great.  It's very easy to set up the timer and looks great sitting on the counter. I'm the only coffee drinker in the house and I love the fact you can just hold a cup underneath and get all the coffee you want without the burnt taste.  Would highly recommend to everyone
 This is my first oil sprayer so I can't say this is better than that or whatsoever. I bought it after reading the reviews here. It was working great for few days and I'm not sure how it happened but I saw a tiny hole on the plastic lid and obviously it couldn't hold the pressure anymore. I purchased it from target.com so I'm not sure about the return policy. I'll have to find out. But other than that it was grea
 I own both the 1-cup and 2-cup and recommend you buy both for measuring liquids. If you don't want to buy both, just buy the 2-cup, as it's more versatile. I have other measuring cups, but these are the ones I reach for over and over. Very convenient - no bending - I love it! Ingenious! My only criticism - and it's very minor - is that the design of the handle makes it wobble slightly rather than sitting firmly on a flat surface. If they correct this minor design flaw, it would get five stars
 We wanted to rid our kitchen of the microwave for health reasons but still have a fast way to get hot water. I never dreamed any small appliance could be this great. Water comes to a rolling boil far faster than the microwave was ever able to do. We liked this so well we bought a second one for the lower level of our home
 I love my Donvier! I got it as a gift a number of years ago and won't let it out of my kitchen. Just last night, I made an impromtu batch of ice cream for a guest, using some over-ripe strawberries in the refrigerator. But once we got started we also added a banana and some pecans, first blended in the blender. The end result was scrumptuous.I love my Donvier!

 Since I liked it so much, I decided to purchase a second one the day the first one arrived. Was very disappointed to see that the price has gone up $10 in just one week! However, the quality is good and I am satisfied with the item
 Lodge makes great products at a great price. This Dutch oven has been in  constant use since we bought it in January -- potatoes, chops, stews,  popcorn, whatever. It does it all. The &quot;nonstick&quot; surface works  as advertised, the inside of the pot is easy to clean and the handle is  industrial strength. Only complaint: The lid can be hard to clean because  of its little spikes on the inside. Check out the great Sprite soda pop  potato recipe they provide with the instructions
 Nordic Ware makes the best looking pans, but this is my favorite pan from Nordic Ware!  This pan makes beautiful breads and cakes.  Because it has a  non-stick coating you might have to adjust your temperature to a higher  setting when baking.  And even though it is non-stick, I suggest that you  spray it with oil before baking because sometimes it does stick!  It's also  very easy to clean up
 We had been enjoying the whole experience of the Keurig B50, when I got the email and blogsite updates over the past few months that Keurig was promoting a new and improved single-cup brewer. I confess - I coveted this new machine in a big way. So when we were the recipients of a bright shiny new B70 last week on our front stoop, it was very much like Christmas for me. My wife just smiled, and the kids gave out a sincere, "Whoa, that's cool!" at our new kitchen friend.We had been enjoying the whole experience of the Keurig B50, when I got the email and blogsite updates over the past few months that Keurig was promoting a new and improved single-cup brewer.

The coffee just tastes good, first and foremost. I've tasted cups from other single-serve brewers, and most of them have been barely more appetizing than generic vending machine drop-the-cup coffee. From my first experience with the Keurig machines, however, I was amazed how good the brew tasted. The home brewers make a great cup of coffee without having to waste a pot, or lose the coffee all over the counter when the previous machine's brew basket got finicky. The additional My K-cup attachments allow for grinding our own beans, too - so as a coffee snob, I'm hooked.Everything that we liked about the B50 is there for the B70 - with the addition of larger cup sizes and the overall look and feel.

And it has a larger reservoir for water, meaning we can get more coffee for fewer refills in the kitchen sink.

The kids oooo and aaahhh every time they walk into the evening kitchen, seeing Daddy's glowing blue coffee brewer, just wanting to marvel in its glow.... okay, that's a little too melodramatic, but only slightly.But wow, it is just so cool looking.

Not just in the store, but blue and glowing in your own kitchen. Trust me - "Merry Christmas" is a great feeling
 When my sons cordless died he went an bought this phone system for himself so that he could keep one in his room and another in his office (located in separate areas of the home).  after he let it charge overnight we tested it out and were ammazed with it it could work inside outside all the way to the mailbox with no/little static!!!  It was/is amazing.  We contacted VTech they offer a very similar model for people with multilines/mailboxes and has the capability to add 7 hand sets--which is great since we all have seperated lines and sep. mailboxes
 I am very pleased with this lightweight, inexpensive teakettle. The size is great; you can make many cups of tea in a single boil, but because the kettle is lightweight, it is still manageable with lots of water inside. Trigger button on handle makes pouring easy and burn-free. I highly recommend this product
 These ramekins are perfect for flan, custard, pudding, and the like.  They are beautiful, yet very heavy duty.  After buying one set in cherry red, I bought another set in flame 2 weeks later.  These are a definate must buy
 I just needed to refute that first review also. This is not a toy, it's not for mixing your ovaltine or slimfast shakes (though it will work for SURE). I assume that's what the first reviewer wanted it for. You can get a 19 dollar piece to do that. It's not "about a foot long!" It's 17 inches, and needs to be. It's also not 20 lbs. It's 2 lbs. and it's weight is perfect. It's not a "hand blender" for mixing water. It's an IMMERSION blender for making the thickest of the thick and the creamiest of the creamiest as far as soups go and 50 other uses. I'm a professional chef, this is part of my kit that I don't leave home without. You shouldn't be home without it
 I feel obligated to defend this terrific appliance against the "misguided" reviewer who likened it to a jack-hammer.  That review gave me pause when I was considering ordering it.  Fortunately I had faith in Amazon's return policy and decided to give it a chance.  It's not at all too heavy or too large.  I'm 5' 3" with small hands and it fits in my hand perfectly.  It really is ergonomically designed.  The power button falls directly under your fingers when you hold it.  You have no need to change your grip until you're through blending--which is next to no time.  It blends thoroughly and efficiently.  It does have enough weight to give you some control.  You wouldn't want something this powerful to be too light--it could just fly out of your grasp.  This feels solid, is very attractive, and also appears to be very well made.  I love it. If you think you might want an immersion blender (and if you cook, you do) you'll love it too.  It should be noted that this is also called an immersion blender. I was confused by the two designations--hand blender/immersion blender.  Apparently they are the same thing although listed separately
 This is a well designed and manufactured tool.  The locking feature makes it convenient to store in a drawer and the black rubber handle makes the tongs comfortable to hold.  I don't know how I did without this tool before.  Another hit for the GOODGRIPS brand
 I really like these pillows, they plump back up during the day when not being used. They are comfortable and hugable

 I love my Keurig coffee maker but missed some of my very  special coffees. Now I can grind and brew my favorites with this filter
 I am surprised to see so many negative reviews.  We've had ours for five or six years, use it at least daily, and have been quite satisified with its performance.  It generally toasts the bread evenly, and is consistent from batch to batch and from one day to the next.  It doesn't seem that slow to me, but my expectations may differ from yours.  I agree the 2/4 slice switch is confusing, but we just leave it on the four-slice setting.  I also agree it is a bit pricey, but most of our previous toasters only lasted a couple of years and did not perform as consistently.  Perhaps Cuisinart has a quality control problem, but we wouldn't hesitate to buy another one.  Good luck
 For the money, I'm satisfied with this toaster. It's pretty much a basic toaster
 Just what I needed to cut veggies for my daily salads.  Saw one similar on a popular cooking show but that one was $40.00 more!  This works just as well I'm sure and such a cool color!  It's easy to find in a drawer or my "wooden spoon jug" where I keep all odd utensils.  It is a little light weight, but after going through carpal tunnel surgery, I don't think I need one much heavier. Fast shipping and great packaging as well.  Another great find from Amazon
 As far as home made ice cream goes, the finnished product turns out pretty good. I would recommend using a mix (Wal Mart and K Mart sell many mixes at only $2) though, for it's much cheaper and tastes better than home made recipies. The only problem is that the ice cream is a little soft when done, otherwise this product is good
 I am not sure what the folks who left negative reviews did wrong, but we got it right the very first time and boy did we ever. We made it a family project on a Sunday night- my Wife, my [...] Daughter and Myself. We froze the pot over night and all day and got it out Sunday evening we poured in our mixture in less than 1/2 hour the alarm sounded, the light turned green, my Daughter gleefuly  pushed the dispense button and out came delicous vanilla softserve. Clean-up not so bad either. We love it. Good family project
 Product lived up to its listed features.  The person who received it as a gift was thrilled with it.  Thank you
 This was exactly as described.  inexpensive, dense wood cutting board on one side with a nice pastry board on the other.  the wood has an attractive grain that is not out of place on the counter full-time.
 Based on the other reviews posted, I purchased this board and am extremely pleased with it. It's nice and big for rolling out all kinds of doughs.  You may have to make room in your cabinet to store it if you don't want it on your counter all the time, but it is worth the trouble.  Also it washes up nicely
 I love having the edge measurements as well as the circular measurments.  I wish I had a cabinet big enough for this wonder tool, but like some of my favorite baking sheets, this will have to live on top of the counter.  After use, it cleans up very nicely, and a coat of mineral oil makes it look like a million dollars.  I'm very satisfied
 same lifespan as single brita filters, lower price. only wish the indicator wasn't the slowness of the filter
 These knives rock. I almost have every knife they make and I love them all. Especially the bread knife!

 This is a great little machine for college students and people with apartments.  Though I wouldn't recomend it for a family (get a bigger version), it was perfect for me and it's quick and easy.  A great buy and very much exceeded my expectations.  I love it
 I received four of these etched glass goblets for Christmas.  They are absolutely beautiful and now are my favorite pieces in my set of winterberry pfaltzgraff dishes.  They are a must to add to your collection
 All I needed was an iron to get the wrinkles out of my cloths for school and this did a very good job. Now to be honest, this is the first iron that I've owned so I don't have anything to compare it will but none the less, for me, it did it's job

Even though we forgot to spray it, the muffins came out clean and easy.  The tray is a definite plus!  We've only used them once, so can't comment on longevity, but our initial use was great.

We got two different Roshco silicon pans, and it does seem that baking times and temps may need to be slightly adjusted and is probably what let to some of the complaints people have listed
 I was pretty hesitant to try a new baking item, but these muffin pans are wonderful! The cleanup is super easy, there is no problem getting the baked item to slip out, and I don't have to worry about rust or tarnish. I would highly recommend this type of new bakeware to anyone who loves to bake, but doesn't love to clean
 The knives are great, dishwasher safe, cut beautifully.  A bargain at the price. But a nicer, more permanent box would be nice
 I couldn't disagree more with the previous reviewer.  I purchased the Oster milkshake maker and use it almost everyday.  Three of my sons love their shakes super thick...the Oster had no problem with the amount of ice cream.  My other son watches his weight for wrestling, and I just put low-fat milk and a little cocoa and the Oster whips up an incredibly thick drink (usually making a glass and a half).  If you put in some crushed ice with milk, it also whips up very thick and frothy.  I am very pleased
 Great product, does what it's suppose to do.  Brushes are the best.  I have three huskies and it handles the dog hair expertly without clogging up.  For being such a heavy, beastly unit, I cannot understand why the handle is built for such a petite hand.  It should be at least an inch longer so I can actually fit my hand in to it
 They do what they hold themselves out to do.  And considering how hard its been finding these items, who can complain
 The dishes came quickly and were in perfect condition. The introductory offer of an Amazon.com credit card allowed me to get a $40 discount and I've been using it since for the reward points. Great doing business with you
 The name Polder keeps appearing in my home!  Why?  Because they make a great and accurate product (s).  Polder is my kind of brand...it does what it's supposed to do and it's not overpriced
 Especially for your guests. But you could use them in your master-bath, of course. The pile & embroidery design is very pretty & very quality looking. I bought towels & hand towels after I was so pleased with the first batch.  They are absorbant and the color is a yummy butter-creamy. And, a great buy. What more can you ask for
 I have a few of these wash clothes sitting in my bathroom closet.  They're beautiful in design and give you an excellent clean feeling after you've used them (with soap and water, of course).  Looking forward to a shower just got a whole lot better
 I've never had trouble fitting my butter stick in the Fiestaware butter dish.  Never.  But the reviewer sho couldn't get hers to fit did give me a chuckle
 I received this cleaver as graduation present when I finished Culinary School and I have been thankful ever since. This is a really nice looking cleaver. The handle is excellent. It looks great feels just right in my hand. It has a good weight to it so that I am able to cut through bones and large pieces of meat with no trouble at all. And with a name like Henckels you cannot go wrong
 I used one of these when I was a teenager working in a pizza joint to scrape dough balls off the pan so I could spin pizza's.

 I've used these for a while and they still hold up pretty well. They say not to put them in the dishwasher but I have and the non-stick is holding up fine. The lids fit nice and tight and the handles don't get too hot - unless you are just taking one of them out of the oven, in that case the handle will be HOT.All said I definately recommend these cause:1.  There is just the right pans for most situations - who really needs 15 pans?2.  You get good quality for the money.3.  The non-stick is terrific
 My husband and I bought this cookware set when we first got married & I absolutely love it!  It has a nice weight to it & the base & walls are thick, also the lids fit perfectly.  It heats evenly & I never have had any problems with food sticking to them.  Just make sure you don't use metal utensils with these or they may scratch the coating, and the only thing I don't like about these is that the oustide can get stained if you let a pan boil over or put it on a burner that is not clean (my husband used to put tortillas & bologna on our coil burner & now I have a stain on the bottom of my frying pan) but I'm sure a little barkeeper's will take it out.  All in all they're great & I highly recommend the
 Though these utensils are not recommended for direct use with the Cuisinart pots and pans (they will scrape the finish) they have a terrific feel to them.  They are evenly balanced with a useful machanical advantage.  I find them especially functional as serving utensils at the table.  This tool set is very well made, each tool has an excellent finish and "look" to it, the long handles and super excellent size for dishing out your cooking creations makes them a positive addition to any kitchen. I really use my set and highly recommend this kitchen tool set!
 I'm a single 47 year old guy.  I'm not a great cook.  I've lost 25# (am now down to 168) and am trying to eat better.  This makes it easy!  No more nuking junk food, or frying food covered in fat, just steam it.  No more worries about burning things (the smoke detector used to be my warning that dinner was done).  I bought the Oster 5712 last week.  I've cooked boiled eggs, frozen chicken breast, Contessa stir fry frozen oriental dinners and frozen fish in it so far.  It rocks!  Tonight I'm going to cook diced chicken breast and wild rice with seasonings in it and I'm 99.9% sure it will turn out great even though I've never tried it before.  This baby makes cooking easy.  Cleaning it is also easy.  No burnt food on it, just hot water.  For cleaning it's almost like is has already been soaking in hot dishwater.  Just a bit of soap and spray it off.  As far as price vs functionality this thing is a steal!  -  Jo
 This product was exactly what I was looking for and now that I have it I am very pleased in the way it works.  It is a darn good steamer
 Took a few minutes to get the hang of using the rolling pin, after that it became a piece of cake.  I love the length, weight and now it is the only rolling pin that I use
 I wish I would have bought one a long time ago. It is so convenient. Easy to clean up. Very nice for grinding nuts in a hurry for baking. Seems powerful enough for everything I have tried it on. You still need to pull out the big food processor for larger amounts because this only holds 1 cup or so. That would be the only negative. Otherwise I love it.I wish I would have bought one a long time ago. It is so convenient. Easy to clean up. Very nice for grinding nuts in a hurry for baking.

 we just bought a new house, and not only is our bedroom the coldest room, we also painted it a blue/grey.  My husband did not want to part ways with our old comforter, even though it didn't match the walls.  This duvet cover was the PERFECT solution.  It is extremely soft and warm, and the "Windstream" colored snowflakes match our walls perfectly.  I may even keep in on the bed in the summer when we have the A/C going in the room
 the quality of this set is very good. they are useful when you eat crabs.at first i thought maybe it was hard to clean them,but i was wrong. they are easy to use and easy to clean.sometimes i also use the clip to crash the nuts. it works great
 This is a very nice seafood set. The OXO brand is always something you can rely on. The only complaint I have about this set is that the cracker is a little bit on the heavy and clunky side
 I bought these in a few colors (at a higher price) about a month ago. They were purchased to replace some designer catalog towels that I mistakenly thought would be of better quality. Well the designer towels shed about 1/2 their heft in my drier.I bought these in a few colors (at a higher price) about a month ago.

You won't be  sorry with these. I am tossing my old towels and using these sets almost exclusively
 Have had this for several weeks. Almost stopped using my stove. Being a bachelor, somewhere I forgot how much better food tastes broiled or on the spit. Have done whole chickens a couple of times, really moist and tender. This is easy to use, and it is a good looking unit. Cooking times are consistent. No problems so far. I have not found the fan to be noisy, perhaps that individual just has a bad unit. My folks sent me some of those big elastic bands to use when you are using the spit. Those work well too
 I agree with all of the other good reviews. I received my waffle maker yesterday and made waffles this morning. All came out great, from the first to the last. Nothing to clean up, just wipe it. I'm completely satisfied
 I have two of these Warmers and use them for much more than butter - especially around the holidays.  They are heavy duty, which you don't see by the pciture, and are also great for melting chocolate, cheese, scalding milk, and much more.  If you need a smaller pan for cooking project, I stongly recommend this one!
 Pictures on-line don't come close to the beauty of the set.  The tea pot is large! The set is worth every penny I paid and then some. I checked other web sites and the price for this set was $150 up to $225. Buy it, you can't find it for less I shopped around prior to making my purchase!

Barrons does an outstanding job on their packaging to protect the pieces during shipping
 Wow! Finally a product that does what it claims to do; it filters water! Incroyable
 This flatware set is beautiful enough for special occasions but practical enough for everyday family use. We wash it in a dishwasher with no special treatment and it comes out shining everytime. My family love the solid feel of the forks
 This shampoo is not only an excellent carpet cleaner, but the additives that neutralize the pet odors from little accidents work incredibly well. I highly recommend this product
 I received this grinder as a Christmas gift from my son-in-law after my cheapo, cheapo grinder went kaput! I am surprised at some of the not so happy reviews because we use this grinder every single day, sometimes twice in one day, and it works really well.

I really like the grinder, and knowing my luck, this Cuisinart will last a long time only because I've had my eye on a Kitchen Aid coffee grinder (to match the rest of my appliances) and just happened to get this one as a gift. Oh well! But, the grinder is worth the money, and it does what it's supposed to do. Unless you're the type of person who needs directions on how to breathe, this grinder is a no-brainer :-
 I had one many years ago and never had a problem. Good suction, maybe a little loud, but I don't care.  I liked it so much I'm trying to get a new one.  I don't recall ever having a problem with it like other reviewers have mentioned -- smoking, etc.  It worked well and cleaned well
 i bought this after reading many reviews and found that they were all in 2 catagories either you loved it or you hated it. i am no exception i really like it. it works like a dream on plush high pile carpets that you can't really run a regular vacuum cleaner over. i don't have any trouble getting it to pick up dirt. the price was great (less than $30) and bags and belts are easy to find and inexpensive. it could have a little more suction in the hose for attachments but it still picks up dirt well. the best use i get out of it  is the roller brush. the roller is very strong and keeps going even when used on deep pile carpets
 This is my third handmixer in a year, finally got something exactly what I wanted.  Great value and powerful.  I highly recommended this product especially for those of u who need it for making different kind of doughs. 
 I used to sell cutlery and own a range of knives myself, so I have tried many cutlery products from many different brands. In 2003, I bought these Calphalon Contemporary shears since I did not own a pair of shears. Before I purchased these, I tried a pair of Henckels Twinshear kitchen shears, and felt that they were not as strong and sharp as I would have liked. I was a little worried about the quality of these shears since they were made in China rather than in Germany or Japan, even though newer brands such as Calphalon and Furi are now making far better cutlery than has ever before been made in China. After over a year of using these, I am quite impressed with them. The handles are very comfortable, and the blades are stronger and sharper than the aforementioned Henckels shears. Most impressively, the blades show very little wear, despite the fact I have certainly used them quite often. Also, the handles on these are far better compared to those on the Calphalon Traditional and Stainless shears. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a top-quality, reasonably priced set of kitchen shears
 The price of this pan threw me, but I decided to give it a try since the cookware is so good.  The pan is the best I've ever used.  It doesn't stick, it cleans up quickly, and it's true, you CAN use metal utensils in it.  I've had the pan for almost a year, and it looks, and bakes, as if it's brand new, even though it is used constantly
 Fiestaware is timeless. Classic shape, classic colors, great quality. The finish is lead-free. The looks are from a bygone era but hold a charm that makes the transition to current styles. Great gift... can always be used. The only drawback I would say is the colors. Sometimes it is difficult to match colors to other brands of dishes you may already have
  This is a brilliant device and the Daddy of pizza wheels, all pizza parlours should buy one or two they would save themselves a fortune! One spin across the pizza and it's done! no repeated to and froing or worse, finishing the job with a knife! It does not need sharpening either, just as well cos I am clueless as to how on earth you would do that job! Oxo brands are just really really good so start collecting now
 This All-Clad ladle is a beauty you'll wonder how you ever did without. Before I bought this, my drawers held only gravy/sauce ladles. You know, those short little things that'll fall down inside your pot and your soup. Buy one of these and suffer that fate no more! Now that I own this, I truly enjoy preparing big pots of stew or soup. You'll feel like a real chef when you dish up portions to your family or friends.
 I use Calphalon commercial hard anodized and wanted to try out stainless steel.  This pan seemed the ideal way to do it, given the price and the manufacturing pedigree (All-Clad).  The first time I used it I fried ham and scrambled eggs in it using less than 2 Tbsp of butter.  Very little stuck to it, and clean up was about as easy as a non-stick pan.  Use a Dobie pad as recommended and you'll have no problems.  I won't trade my Calphalon for stainless, but having said that, it looks great, heats evenly, and cooks like a champ.  Well worth the $20.  Give it a try and leave the Wear-Ever non-stick behind
 The scale I received from Amazon looks the same as the picture for the "Soehnle Vera White Digital Food Scale" but it's a different model. The one I received uses the CR-2430 lithium battery, not four AAs as advertised. Also, the product manual is different. The actual manual's title is "67000 - 67007 g/oz," not "8122/8123 g/oz." On the bottom of the scale, there is a number similar to Soehnle's product numbers, 812215. But I could not find such a product anywhere.The scale I received from Amazon looks the same as the picture for the "Soehnle Vera White Digital Food Scale" but it's a different model.

 This is my first food processor and I am thrilled with my Cuisinart.  It is a perfect size for my needs and very easy to use. 
 This product provide a couple of interesting issues. The first one: You don't need electricity to make it work on your table (No cables on your fancy candle-light-dinner); the second one: It works. All you need is to let it rest in your fridge, and that's it
 Even though its a 10" bowl, its not deep enough for salads
 The item is what I expected at this price. I like the shape of the dishes and bowls.  My only complaint is that a dessert dish broke in shipping and it took forever for a new one to arrive and it was chipped
 I have Cuisinart DLC-2011 Prep 11 Plus Food Processor for about a year and i wouldn't even think that i could use it so much. I've got additional discs and i can do anything. It's fast, it's reliable, it's really helpfull. I would probably ish to have a bigger size, but this one is ok and i didn't want to spend more. I've spent the difference in price on discs and discs holder.I have Cuisinart DLC-2011 Prep 11 Plus Food Processor for about a year and i wouldn't even think that i could use it so much.

 I love my cuisinart prep 11 plus food processor.  Since I use it for all sorts of cooking, I have purchased all of the disks for it.  I don't want three or four different holders for disks, etc. because I don't have unlimited closet and counter space.  Since they sell a complete set of disks why, oh, why don't they sell a tower (small footprint) that will hold all of the attachments.  This is short sighted of them.  I have friends who have the same gripe.  If someone manufactures such a disk holder we would be interested in knowing how to contact that company
 Bye whisking you away I froth, foam and easily handle all your whisking problems away. My handle is so secure it will absoutley amaze you with  its workability. Please try me so I can whisk you into my recipes, now

 I sent this knife to my son who is a baker by profession--he loves this knife.  It doesn't mash the bread and cuts through crusty crusts! I higly recommend it to anyone
 It's a pretty good down pillow. It's well filled and doesn't feel too low to me. The label on the pillow itself states minimum 75% down, but I couldn't feel any feathers, so the down quality is decent. The cover is nice and it doesn't smell more then any other new down pillow. The pillow is machine washable, so you can wash it to get rid of smell faster
 I really love these bed sheets.  From the moment I got them I put them on my king size bed and I almost didn't want to take them off to wash them. They are very comfortable and of a very good quality.  The fitted sheet does have deep pockets indeed so they stay attached to the matress even after several days of use.  I am very pleased with this product
 My friend Orri suggested the Breville 800JEXL. My husband, who enjoys dishes to cooking, has become the expert juicer. It's definitely worth the extra money if you are serious about juicing. Remember.... If you're in a rush, but want juice, simply wash the breville off and save the soaping for the dishwasher. The clean up is really not bad if you cook and are use to doing dishes. Have fun. Ginge
 I got this to use with my rotisserie and have ended up using it everywhere I cook meat.  Its ease of use and ease to clean makes it a favorite in my kitchen tool drawer. 
 FABULOUS!!!  I purchased this as a gift for relatives who are very highly educated, worldy, well travelled, serious chefs, who've enjoyed coffee brewed all over the world (even Antarctica!).  Needless to say, gift buying for them is tricky!  When they got this, their Bodum decanter had just broken, so the timing was perfect...they love this model! Use it daily!  In fact, they're so impressed, that they now order it from Amazon.com & give it as a wedding gift to newly married couples in their social circle.  Also note, there is a coordinating sugar & creamer set available for purchase that matches perfectly, holds adequate volumes of sugar & cream, & makes a stunning table display.  I already have a few Bodum sets, including the stainless steel insulated models, so I won't need another FP, but I also will give this Frieling model as a wedding/housewarming gift to coffee aficionados.
 I like it's size, weight, and the fact that it is clear glass so you can see the tea.  I keep it warm at my desk with the aid of a coffee cup warmer and one cup will last for several hours.  The strainer works flawlessly for me

 Great Product for a good price.  All sent as ordered
 The previous reviewer was correct. This item does not have the pump and hose for using it without a garden hose. I was easily able to order these parts and the clip to hold the pump from the Coleman website. Just look at the hot water on demand there and open the replacement parts link.

 I LOVE THIS PITCHER IT SITS ON MY COUNTER ALL THE TIME.BEATIFUL COBALT BLUE COLOR,WITH WHITE INSIDE,REALLY ADDS SOMETHING TO CREAMERS,WISH ... SOLD THE BIG ONE I WOULD BUY IT IN A HEART BEAT.GREAT FOR SYRUP ALSO
 We've had this coffee pot for about 3 months and absolutely love it.  Once you learn how everything sits correctly you can have great coffee all the time.  It's great having the coffee already in the pot.  We get about 4 pots of coffee from what is stored.  The only thing I would have liked better was a 12-cup coffee pot.  I sometimes find after we have our coffee in the morning and with my husband taking a thermos has me sometimes having to make another pot.  It's no big deal though because it's so easy.  You'll love it. 
 I purchased this product the day before going on vacation, so i didn't have much time to research.  I've owned it for 28 days, and it's been working fine so far.  I use small pellets, not flakes- so that's all i can rate it for.  It seems to work at the same times every day, and a uniform amount of food appears to drop.  It is not quiet, so if it is used in a bedroom, make sure you adjust your feeding times as not to be disturbed while sleeping.  I acually don't mind knowing when it's running, so if i'm around I can check on it's function. Time will tell if it's a great product- but so far, so good.I purchased this product the day before going on vacation, so i didn't have much time to research.

I'd often have to remove and replace the batteries to get it to work again. I'd look elsewhere before buying another
 What I especially appreciate about this mug is that, unlike cheaper stainless steel mugs, this one does not impart a metallic flavor to tea. It really insulates, beverage stays hot for hours while the mug feels cool to the touch. My husband and I each have one. Don't leave home without it
 As a long time critic of kitchen tools and ALL Miracle Whip applicators, I was skeptical when I was presented with this device. It uses the same "scraper/spatula" design that has been prevalent in the United States since the release of the Tupperware model R. At first glance I was not impressed with this tool. It was nothing flashy, although I must admit the red color was quite innovative. But, the real test would have to come when I put it into service. She wasn't as stiff as some of the hard plastic models I have tested, but not as floppy as most silicone models I have labored through. I would have to say it was a happy medium. So I dug right in and began making some fried wonton stuffed with Miracle Whip, and I must say this spatula sparkled. Pounds of Miracle Whip got stuffed into this little Asian number, and the spatula never failed. I knock off one point for the simple fact, that they don't offer a Miracle Whip branded version of this spatula. Now that would be really nice. Also, not quite strong enough to be used a tactical weapon, but quite suitable as a disciplinary tool
 This one works great.  I had a square krupps waffle maker before and this one is ten times better....cooks better, heats faster, looks better, and the audible ready alert is great.  I saw this one on Good Eats on Food Network, and I am thrilled that I have this one....exactly what I wanted
 Until I purchased this meat grinder, I was grinding with a manual one.  It was a chore to set up and clean up.  The Pro MG-800 Professional Meat Grinder made the grinding easy.  It does not have to be clamped on the table.  Ground meat comes out nicely into a bowl underneath.  Easy clean up, fast speed, three blades interchangeable for the grinding.  I am totally happy with the product I purchased.  Also, on top of being an efficient grinder it is very compact that does not take much space for storing.   The advantage of having a grinder is I can grind my preferred cut anytime and know what went into the ground meat
 Tired of those metal cocktail shakers where the top refuses to open when you go to clean it?  The vacuum that occurs with the metal variety has happened to us on every model we've tried.  The Boston Cocktail Shaker does not have this problem.  We had no difficulty whatsoever with a tight seal on the first try and have had no leakage problems.  The only drawback (very minor) is that the measurement lines do not go all the way to the bottom of the glass.  So if you're measuring out small quantities of liquor, you still need to use a jigger.  Other than that, it is very easy to use and clean.  Top rating for this bar helper
 My dad originally bought one of these woks from lodge and we use it for everything. We can brown all sorts of meats for varying dishes. For Stir-frying it is incredible, nothing sticks to it and we don't have to  worry about even cooking. I have recently purchased one for myself and I  couldn't be happier with it. At less than 50 is is a great bargain. Another  great use for it is deep frying. It is a tad heavy so do not try to pick it  up and serve because it will very easily slip from your hands. Overall my  favorite cooking tool ever

 I like these lid covers as they fit very well.  I have always had a hard time with plastic wrap sticking, or aluminum foil tearing.  I would recommend this if you need to store your recipes for a bit before serving them.  I also like the sturdiness of these lids as it does not allow flavors to mix when you put them in the refrigerator
 There isn't much you say about a plasic cover, but I'll try...  These  covers fit securely over the bowl for kepting whatever you're mixing fresh.   You can also store anything in it like it was a tuperware (spelling?)  item.  I'd recomend having them around, because you'll use them!  These are  for the 4 1/2 quart bowl and are dishwasher safe
 This thing is wonderful. I've enjoyed one since my first home and it makes a tremendous difference- esp. if you rent and don't have any control over the kind of tub you have.
 I bought this sheet set almost 5 months ago & they have actually become my favorite sheets.  I have several sets, and many of them were quite exepensive, but i always seem to reach for these sheets.  The only time we use another set is when we are washing these.  They are very soft & stretchy (not too stretchy)and wash up so nice(they hold the dryer warmth so well)!  This set has been great during the summer & i think will also be great during the colder months with a heavier blanket.  You couldn't get a better set anywhere near this price!
 My teapot arrived from Amazon very quickly and I was very pleased with my first purchase. It is just the right size for me as I usually make two or three cups. Even though it could hold more, it is not too large for a smaller amount. The tea does not drip when poured . . . thank goodness! The one I had before consistently dripped so my reason for getting a new one. This one also fits well in my hand, and I love the fact that you can microwave it if you need to heat up a bit. Overall, I would say it is quite lovely and and high quality
 Item exactly as promised. Was a gift for Dad's new wife. She was very happy with it
 Even if entering the kitchen gives you hives, this spoon can make it easier. It's balanced, easy to use and easy to clean and store.  It goes from the cooktop to serving in a contemporary fashion...WITHOUT spilling, breaking like some of the el-cheapo brands.  If you care for this spoon - it will serve you well for many years.  My first one - I used to death and it died only as a result of an accident with (in?) the blender.  Been searching for one ever since to replace - and at this price I am buying several
 This is a great product, not only does it boil water fast, it is easy to fill and use, and pours beautifully
 Very nice, beats flimsy plastic. I have broken or otherwise worn out parts of plastic measuring sets. These will probably outlast me
 I bought this for Chinese / Japanese style hotpot.  It turned out to be a fabulous hotpot (fast boiling time) and an excellent grill! Although there are no grill grids, my Korean BBQ and Cajun shrimps turned out wonderful!!!  I have used this pot extensively (once or twice a week) for the past three months and it continues to perform superbly
 I have had these pans for five years now and I use them almost every night.  I have never had any problems with them and they cook the food very evenly.  I would highly recommend them. 
 This thing is a workhorse... I use it every day. Mine's been going strong for over five years now. I just wish they'd bring back the translucent colors. I love being able to see at a glance whether the kettle has water in it or not. With the current opaque black or white models that's not possible.
 I have made yogurt with a few tablespoons from the super market or with a previous batch, but sometimes I sweeten the whole batch with honey and forget to reserve some of the good stuff.  I probably use these every other batch or so now.When I first started making yogurt, using these packets allowed me to vary the time and/or add powdered milk until I found my perfect batch!  I don't add powdered milk - it makes it thicker but more tart and I prefer it a bit thinner after getting addicted to it in Europe last year.This is the perfect tool for newbies - and a cupboard staple for the more seasoned yogurt-heads
 The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere.

 It's common to see these steamers all over the place and from Amazon's display, this certainly didn't look any different.  What made me decide to get this was the price and when I opened the box and examined it, I was pleased to find how well-made this item is
 WE HAVE A NEW PUPPY AND I BOUGHT THIS CLEANER.  WHEN I READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS I ALMOST RETURNED IT UNOPENED.  FOR SOME REASON I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I HAD JUST RENTED AN INDUSTRIAL SIZED RUG DOCTOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO TO DO MY CARPETS.  I JUST WANTED TO TRY THIS TO SEE HOW IT WOULD DO.  THE DIRT AND DOG HAIR I GOT OUT WAS AMAZING.  IT WAS VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND TO USE.  I RECENTLY HAD SHOULDER SURGERY AND THIS WAS VERY EASY TO OPERATE WITH ONE ARM!  THANK YOU SO MUCH
 I love to spend my time in the kitchen, but what I don't like to spend is obscene amounts of money.

But after receiving it and using it, I don't regret the extra money at ALL. This set has been more than faithful to me in the time I've had it - it's dependable, I can toss it into the dishwasher with no fears and the labels won't rub off. I'm not afraid of abusing this set; it's stood up to my frantic mad dashes around the kitchen from the cookie dough to the spaghetti sauce. If your old set has worn down to nothing and you're looking for something that will stay in your kitchen longer and more faithfully than you will -- this is the set for you.
 After years of trying to make smoothies in a regular blender, and having to stop and stir, and stop and stir, and worry about burning out the motor, we now don't have to worry any more. Even when ALL of the fruit we add is frozen, this machine grinds, chops, and smooths with impressive power. It's fairly easy to clean, provided you don't wait for days, and has a handy pouring valve thing. A few recipes are included
 I am so pleased with these sheets.  Prior to this purchase, the most thread count I had in my sheets was 600.  These 1000-thread-count sheets are much more luxurious.

 This is my second DLC-10.  The only reason for replacement is because the bowl cracked and it became cost effective to just make a machine rerplacement.  I have all the disks and such and like the machine very much as I have had it for 20 years
 The processor works terrific! It saves us much time everyday.One minor problem is some foods get stuck between the cover and the blade and can not be processed

 It's sort of cheap, but it works quite well.  The water comes out clean, with no odd taste (which some filter systems can do)
 This is the best French Oven I have ever used. It cooks evenly and cleans easily. While it is very heavy, that must add to the excellence of its cooking and that's what I wanted. No complaints. 5 Stars
 I am buying a replacement that I had for 15 years. It still works but the light went off.  I never thought they were still making it. I tried recently 2 other brands that did not make it 1 month paid around $25. I gave up, I was still using my old Westclck  until today when I found this one on Amazon.
 We have a large family and we use our electric skillet a lot.  In the past we have purchased the cheaper versions from Wal-mart.  They don't heat evenly, and we were constantly replacing them because the cheap plastic legs or handles would break.  The Cuisinart CSK-150 1500-Watt Nonstick Oval Electric Skillet is AWESOME!!  The cooking area is huge (we can cook 6 pancakes at a time easily) and the cooking surface heats up evenly.  It is very heavy, so it doesn't scoot around on the counter.  Nice metal handles an base.  Glass lid is also very sturdy with a steam vent.  It is very beautiful and functional. Because of the quality of the construction, I believe it will last our family for many years. I have not previously recommended any item online before, but I highly recommend this item
 I have owned this can opener now for several months and it is BY FAR the BEST can opener I have ever owned.  I have had probably 10 electric openers in my lifetime, but this is just wonderful.  It is smooth, super easy to attach the can, quiet, and does NOT splatter the contents of the can all over the opener when it's done cutting like all the other did!!!  The detachable parts make it sanitary too, you can put it in the dishwasher! I can't say enough about this opener....you will NOT be disappointed!!I have owned this can opener now for several months and it is BY FAR the BEST can opener I have ever owned.

 Hey, not to be too redundant but this really is a good Can Opener. I have NO problems with it, my wife, who always has problems with can openers has "some" problems "sometimes" using it but as she NEVER could get any of the others to ever work this is a big improvement. The knife sharpener is an okay touch, however, if you have good knives I wouldn't use it. I sharpen by hand with an "Edge Pro" but hey, it's a CAN OPENER. It will sharpen a knife I just wouldn't put my $100 Schaaf "Golden Hamster" through, maybe my Chicago for a quick fix
 I've never had a "nice" set of knives before. These are great! They have a nice feel in my hands. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because the kitchen scissors do not come apart. The scissors I bought at Smart & Final come apart for easy washing and drying
 A dutch oven is one of the most versatile items you can find. Many people I know are intimidated by cooking with dutch ovens, but when you take a few minutes to learn how, you can use it to cook anything! It can be used with variety of foods: stews, cakes, cobblers, breads, poultry, vegetables (basically anything you make in a conventional oven). If you happen to forget to pack your skillet when you go camping, turn over the lid and put it back on the dutch oven. Voila! Instant skillet-type cooking surface!   Additionally, this smaller dutch oven stacks well with the 12-inch version, so you can cook more than one course at a time!A dutch oven is one of the most versatile items you can find.

 The other review is so obviously someone from SENTRY that I thought I'd add my two cents. My house hasn't burned down so I don't know if this works, but I've read other articles that say it does. It is heavy (since the foam contains water to evaporate and dissipate heat in a fire), and there is no rubber grips on the bottom, so it can slide around a lot. It's a lot cheaper and more convient than renting a safety deposit box.

 Enjoy your sleeping hours in quality sheets with beautiful Butterflies embroidered on the pillow cases & top sheets..an awesome deal for yourself or a gift for someone you want to bless
 this set conducts heat really well and everything heats up fast but be careful not to burn anything which I did the first time using it. Also it takes a bit of scrubbing if you burn it bt other than that it's a great product
 I know these got poor reviews, as ice cube trays.  But I used them to freeze my baby's homemade fruits and veggies and they worked great.  The lids were a little tricky at first, but as long as you don't overfill them, you'll have no problems removing the lids.  A couple twists of the tray, and the food cubes slid right out!  They were much cheaper than trays marketed specifically for freezing baby food
 I got this for my wife for her Birthday and she loves it. No more staining other spatula's or spoons
 So when it came up on my Gold Box offers, I knew I had to have it !  It is great !  Beautiful, sleek and also useful !  It looks great in my yellow kitchen too !  The pitcher is heavy duty without feeling too heavy.  Makes a nice piece on your table during that special dinner at home 
 I cooked 2 cobblers for our scout troop that even the pickiest eater was coming back for more.Terrific piece for any campers , practically a must have
 I am very impressed with the feel and size of this mug.  It has a smooth feel, and keeps the coffee/tea hot/warm.  I ordered one, but will probably be ordering more! Nice! :o

 No picture can really do these glasses justice.  They have nothing aesthetic in common with any other double-walled cup I've ever seen--elegant, minimalist, super clear and light as a feather.  They really keep stuff cold (or hot, as the case may be).  They're even dishwasher safe.  However, they are remarkably fragile.  I accidentally rapped a spoon on the lip of one and within half an hour, the little crack had spread and the glass was in fragments.  But if you're careful with them and keep them away from kids, animals, and, apparently, me, they will serve you well
 I ordered these towels in two colors mainly because the price was right.  But when they arrived I was so pleased.  They're larger than I expected and very plush.  I've washed them several times and they look as good as when I first opened them.  It's really nice to finally have towels that actually dry you off
 These towels are great! I was surprised how large they are, but it's been a while since I bought towels, maybe all new towels are really big.  These towels are so absorbent, it's hard to tell when they've been used because the water just seems to disappear.  And soft, soft, soft...brand new out of the box they feel great.  Again, they're big, so a litle heavy, but they are wonderful.  These are an amazing bargain and feel very luxurious.  I don't know what towels those other reviewers said resulted in fuzzies, they must have been referring to another product, these towels are awesome, no fuzzies, they are very well made
 I have used every major brand of cutlery and I can tell you there is no better value than analon knives. I have been cooking and managing restuarants for over 30 years and I have found that the $100 knives are no better than thr $25 ones. The analon product looks and feels just as nice as the most expnesive brands out there and is one third the price. Try them you will love them. I might add that all knives have to be reground from time to time as the edge will become blunt and no sharpener will restore it. When this happens find a local grinding service and have them restored. A good knife can last you a lifetime if you take care of it happy chopping Mik
 If you like knives that hold their edge, have good balance, and feel more expensive than they really are, this knife's a smart purchase.  We bought ours with the intent to get Henckels. My husband loves to cook and I have demanding standards for tools in my kitchen, especially knives.  Anolon were half the price and every bit as good.  As their reputation spreads, the prices seem to be going consistently up. 
 We looked in all the local brick and mortar stores for a quality holder with no luck.We looked in all the local brick and mortar stores for a quality holder with no luck.Even though we were skeptical ordering online, this product far exceeded our expectations.Even though we were skeptical ordering online, this product far exceeded our expectations.Do not hesitate, it is well worth the asking price
 Everyone who comes in and sees this just loves it.  I'm getting several for Christmas presents this years to give to all my friends.  I mounted mine over the sink because that is where I do most of my slicing and dicing.  It also keeps my knives sharper because you're not sliding them in and out of the wood blocks.  It even holds my knife sharpener

 These are great beer mugs! I ordered 4 sets of them for myself and 2 for my brother. The first thing I noticed when I received them was that they were thick and HEAVY. The bottom isn't completely solid, but has space for a small pocket of air when it's sitting on the counter. It's inconsequential though, because the glass in these mugs is as thick as you would want any of your thick glass beer mugs. When I saw how nice they were, I actually went back online and bought 2 more and their margarita set which was also rediculously cheap ($15 for 6 glasses and a picher). I've been recomending these mugs to all my friends that drink
 It was just what I needed.  I inherited the mixer but it didn't have the beater.  So now I have one and it works perfectly
 This size is perfect for actually using. It gets thrown into the dishwasher and gets used every day. Love it
 These dishes are beautiful and very nice quality, I will be buying more
 Firstly, I am into high quality at an affordable price, so I thank Cuisanart for providing just that in all of their cookware. Two-quarters are the most handy in my kitchen and at least one non-stick needs to be available. I use mine more and more just for the ease of clean-up. The interior finish seems durable and shows no signs of damage. I would expect it to last a very long time with reasonable care. The price is great for the quality; you'll be pleased with your purchase.
 This scale has worked perfectly for me for the last year or so.  It is very easy to use.  It looks great and has a permanent place on our counter.  I wish all consumer electronic products were designed and built to the same standards as this scale
 Theres not alot I can say about measuring spoons really. They are made to a high standard, durable, easy to clean and dishwasher safe. At this price I dont see why you would need to pay more for a set of measuring spoons unless it was for decorative reasons
 The Zyliss ice cream scoop cuts through the hardest ice cream, which means I no longer have to wait for hubby to get home to have a scoop!
 Listen to those other reviewers who have sung the praises of this scoop! The Zyliss Scoop goes through cold ice cream very well and literally drops off the scoop into the bowl. Well worth the money. How nice to have a tool that works well. Like others, I've tried many scoops that did NOT work - frustrating!! Do yourself a favor: stop bending your soup spoons and get a Zyliss Ice Cream Scoop.
 It works great, and it's small (6" high, 5" diameter) and easy to use. May require some experimentation to get times correct for your own microwave. For me: 7 minutes for soft, 8 min for medium, and 9-10 min for hard eggs on high power (700W microwave).It works great, and it's small (6" high, 5" diameter) and easy to use.

For me: 7 minutes for soft, 8 min for medium, and 9-10 min for hard eggs on high power (700W microwave).It does get very hot, so you need to remove it from the microwave with a potholder or towel. I place the whole thing under the cold tap, then remove the top, and cool the eggs under running water for a minute before peeling

 Initially I was very surprised by how large the tools were. They are much bigger than any tool I've bought previously. If you don't have much space in the kitchen, I'd think twice about buying these tools.  However, after using them I think they are quite sturdy and useful.  Eventhough they are large, they are not heavy and sometimes there size is quite helpful.  You can pick up a whole fried egg with the spatula, for example. I am happy with my purchace, because the price was good
 I've been cooking aebleskivers for several years in an excellent no-name cast iron pan that I bought in Solvang ten years ago.  It is very well broken in with a smooth non-stick patina in all seven indents.  I want to teach my sons how to cook aebleskivers themselves because they will be out on their own soon, and it never hurts to be able to attract a woman who loves Danish delicacies!

I like the design a lot and am impressed with how it heats up quickly and holds it's temperature nicely.  The first batch of aebleskivers had some sticking, but I expected that.  I will need to use it a lot more before it has the same non-stick surfaces as my old pan (no, it's not for sale!), but I can tell that this pan will get there with use.Therefore, I have been looking to buy some additional aebleskiver pans and I was excited to see this new pan from Lodge, so I ordered one to give it a try.

I'm sure that they all will work well with some practice, but I'll describe the one that I've settled on, because it is so easy:Heat the pan at a medium-low setting.  Take about two cups of prepared pancake mix (I use Krusteaz Buttermilk) and add a couple of teaspoons of sugar.  Mix it in and stir in enough cold water to make the consistency about the same as you would for drop bisquits.  Don't overmix it and let it sit for awhile to rise a bit before you cook it.  Put a little butter or margerine in each indent and add about a teaspoonful of batter to each indent (If you're new to aebleskivers, I recommend trying only three at once.)  I then drizzle a little butter on the edges of each indent.  After about a minute, I use a knitting needle (or chopstick) to turn each aebleskiver one quarter turn.  I add a little more butter and then turn them so the round side is up.  I keep turning them with a spoon until they're done.  (You'll just have to break one of them open to check, because it's dependent on your batter and temperature.)Heat the pan at a medium-low setting.

Once you eat them, you'll understand why people go through all this just to make a pancake that looks like a racquetball! 
 i've had this can opener 4 more than 5 years & have never had a problem!!!  i even let my 4-year old niece use it when she stays with me & helps me cook.  never have 2 worry about anything with this one
 This is a wonderful can opener!!! I wouldn't have any other. The trick to having perfectly cut edges is to let the can spin around twice. I hold onto the can so that when it starts making its second round, I tighten my grip a little and the moment the lid comes lose it starts spinning. I have noticed that if I buy the dirt cheap, no name vegetables at the dollar store, the opener has difficulty. I guess one should blame the can and not the opener. It is a small price to pay for having such a safe appliance around. But then my opener is a couple years old so maybe my blade is just wearing out... If there is no replacement blade, you can bet I will buy another can opener just like this, and if I have to, on Ebay! I am sure this new technology has saved more than one lost or stray animal digging at the landfill or in the alley for a morsel of food. I just couldn't bear the thought of someone's lost puppy or an abandoned cat getting his tongue cut. Those old can openers are just plain dangerous. Call me a bleeding heart but it matters. It's not like my own pet couldn't knock the trash over when I'm gone and end up cutting themselves on one of those old fashioned, razor sharp lids. There are both elderly and child relatives in my house all the time and I just don't feel safe with those old tin cutters around. All it takes is a little patience with new technology and using this can opener on more than just a couple cans to get the hang of it. There is no need to slam this appliance on the counter or floor. That's rediculous. As far as oversized cans, that's not what this was made for.  
 I have to admit that I was surprised when the rolling pin arrived. I'm used to OXO quality, but this is over the top. It is a big rolling pin, with an ideal diameter. It is also heavy. It's heft helps keep it where it belongs, instead of bouncing around on the dough and making you work harder. It has a strong axle, which glides remarkably smoothly, even when the pressure is on. The hard non stick surface works very well, and does not pick up butter grease like some other coatings. The handles are simply the best I have have encountered. This is a very well designed kitchen tool that fully lives up to the &quot;Good Grips&quot; promise of quality
 I had seen my Japanese coworkers carry this thing to work.  It's a great lunch bag! Beats brown bagging, because hot foods stay hot, and cold foods stay cold.  I finally bought one because of the ease of use, didn't want to keep paying $$$ for hot lunches, and I can always bring my favorite foods.  The bottom container is the only leakproof container. (That is my only gripe.) I usually put soup in here.  The other containers will hold things without sauces very well.  It's great because it allows for a large variety of foods (better nutrition).  I have used bento lunch boxes since I was kid, and this is the best for adults. I like asian food, and this type of lunch box accomodates the best.

They also make bigger versions for larger appetites and another smaller one for small appetites.  They really do stay hot. Once I had to take a very late lunch, I packed it at 7am, and at 2:30pm the food was still hot. No more waiting in line to microwave your lunch !!!
 They are working well so far. They stain a little when grease gets on them
 This makes baking so much easier, things just pop right out.  The light weight and noiselessness of the product make this a real winner.  Baking just keeps getting easier and easier.  I have replaced all my bakeware possible with these silicone bakeware items.  I love them
 When I decided to buy this oven, I was not even looking to buy a convection toaster oven.  I stumbled across this item looking for cookware.  I read all the reviews, thought about it a few days and then decided to just buy it.  Boy, am I glad that I did!!!  And so is my family.  The day we received it, I cooked muffins for my daughter and her friend for a snack.  Extremely easy.  All I needed was six muffins and the oven did just that for me.  Since then, we have cooked more muffins, a meatloaf, bacon, toast, english muffins, chicken strips, waffles and bratwurst.  My kitchen doesn't heat up like when I use my regular oven and the food has turned out better than when cooked in the regular oven.  It was so easy for my husband to use this also while I was shopping and I just gave him a 15 second class before I left.  I didn't notice any smoking when cooking meat or any of the other foods.  This is my first Convection Toaster oven, which has replaced the microwave and toaster, and I can assure you we expect to use this oven alot.  I love the design, the warming tray does just that, even when you have something else cooking you can throw buns or anything else up top to keep warm.  It's great! The oven is big enough to cook meatloaf or chicken breasts and yet is not so monstrous that you lose your entire counter for one appliance.  I would recommend this to anyone.  What a great idea for the kitchen
 Very good buy for $85 +free ship. Bought this one to replace a smaller Black & Decker toaster oven that served us very well over 5-6 years until controls gave out (the B&D still works, just have to keep the button pressed in).  Very good buy for $85 +free ship. Bought this one to replace a smaller Black & Decker toaster oven that served us very well over 5-6 years until controls gave out (the B&D still works, just have to keep the button pressed in).  I looked at reviews of several toaster ovens before purchasing the T-Fal.  The less expensive ones ($25-$40) were getting dinged because of occasional mentions of overheating or fire risk.  Not worth the chance.  I also wanted something as small as possible because we have little counter space in our 10' x 10' kitchen, so a more expensive one was not an option.

The T-fal gave dimensions on Amazon & it was 3 inch wider, deeper, taller than our B&D.  No big deal - wrong.  It was bigger than I thought when I put it on the counter, looked like a monster compared to the B&D.  Also, I could not open the top warmer lid to the point it stays open.  This because of height restrictions -- bottom of my kitchen cabinet is at about 54 - 60 inches.  I can open the top, but I need to hold it open.  My fault, not the product or mfr.  But be aware that size matters in a small kitchen.The T-fal gave dimensions on Amazon & it was 3 inch wider, deeper, taller than our B&D.  No big deal - wrong.

You can set how long it stays on, and it beeps (electronically) three times when it shuts off.  There is a clock, but it could be easier to set.

I mainly use it to toast bread, bagels, sandwiches and to bake small pizzas (sauce with cheese on a pita - easy).  The toast function takes longer than the old B&D (about 4.5 vs 2 minutes), but thats OK by me.  The bake function works very well, I prefer it muchly over starting the oven to bake something small.I mainly use it to toast bread, bagels, sandwiches and to bake small pizzas (sauce with cheese on a pita - easy).

It's controllable, not a big deal, unless you don't know about it.  I did know thanks to previous reviews and I was prepared for it.  The fan was louder than I expected (I expected no noise since the B&D has no fan).  But it is a soft sound, lower than my computer fan and only on during cooking.The fan was louder than I expected (I expected no noise since the B&D has no fan).

 Overall this is a fine scale.  One "convenient" feature is an auto zero function.  If the scale has been tared and the tare weight removed, rather than displaying a negative weight, the scale automatically re-zeros.  This may be handy most of the time, but sometimes it's a pain.  With my old scale, I could tare a partially filled bowl, remove the bowl from the scale, add more goodies, and place it back on the scale to determine the weight of the additional material.  That doesn't work with this scale--it rezeros when a tared weight is removed
 I hope these things are airtight because I just bought my fourth set.  I don't buy the freezer storage containers because I own these.  They can be used in cooking and freezing so I save on pricey disposable freezer bags. The little ones I use to store one package each of corn starch, yeast, baking powder, baking soda, three hamburger patties and to prepare, freeze and bake individual sized servings of salmon fillets.I hope these things are airtight because I just bought my fourth set.

The medium ones and the large ones are for leftovers, soup fixings, freezer meals, steaming chicken, fruit salad et al. I'm ten percent tempted to try out the rectangular ones because some foods I don't want to freeze in a stack but I don't think I would get as much use out of them as I do these round ones.  I really would like to buy a fifth set but I won't. I rarely have more than one or two empty ones to spare. These get used all the time. I really didn't like using plastic wrap or aluminum foil to refrigerate food.  These lids are more secure and therefore I am less stressed
 It does the job, cook my sushi rice perfectly and no burn. So much better than my old black and decker
 I couldn't be more satisfied if my stock pot had cost 10 times as much
 The AeroBed Premier Raised Queen sized bed is a Godsend.  Due to a disability, I needed a raised bed that would allow me the convenience of a somewhat normal height bed, so my husband & I could camp with other family members at a recent family reunion.  The AeroBed Premier Raised not only afforded me that ability, but also provided a surprisingly comfortable night's sleep as well.  The bed is made of the highest quality material, and did not lose any air.The AeroBed Premier Raised Queen sized bed is a Godsend.

 Although it's a 'chicken fryer', I use it to pan-fry everything, and it works amazing! The depth of the pan allows larger amount of food inside, being stirred without spilling out. And the smaller diameter helps to concentrate heat in the pan. The nonstick feature truly works, nothing sticks to the pan, even the thick starch
 Definitely a nice knife.  I really like the unibody and the blade is very sharp.  Clean cutting knife
 I love these little clips.  They are small in size and useful for hanging a shopping list, a note, and things of this sort.  Their magnets are strong and colors quite pleasant to look at. 
 I got this blender some years ago, I don't even remember how long, because of the price.  Then my finances got better and promised to myself once it broke I would change it for a nice new chrome steel model... but the friggin' thing keeps on going and going, so, I'm stuck with it until who knows when. 
 The Polder 5416-97 Essential Dual Leg Ironing Board is easy to lift and to fold.  It stores neatly in small spaces.  It's sturdy and will last a long time.  The cover and pad is very colorful
 This is the simplest, but one of the best kitchen must haves I have purchased in a long time.  The peel is whisked of the garlic in seconds.  Easy to clean, easy to store.  No more garlic hands
 I am using this pad on a aerobed, so this wont be a good review for a person using it on a full sized mattress (I don't know if it will fit, it looks like it will but I haven't tried it).  However, I can tell you that this is a durable mattress pad.  It went camping with us without a problem.  And it washes easily.  those are important factors to consider
 Love the pan, the center is so cool, because you can tell when the product is pre-heated.....the center changes and it is so great.  The pan is almost too big, but it is perfect for everything I can possibly cook in it
 This pan suited my needs exactly.  It's handle is comfortable to hold and it has nice even heat distribution.  The handle and the curve of the outside edge make flipping food quite easy
 These are the best ones I have seen so far.  You'll love the martini design!  A great bargain
 I recently broke two of my favorite pieces of Corelle Baking and Serving Dishes. I looked on several sites and it seemed all I could find was the handleless French Style Corningware, which I have and find hard to use due to being without handles. This Bakeware has great handles and I love it. I love the Chutney on the side, I compared this price with ordering just two piece of the same thing in Abundance Design and the oblong baking dish separate and it was $10.00 more without the ramkins. This was a better value
 I like the pistoulet dinnerware and specially the bread plates.  But after some dishwasher, the paint begin to peel off. At least, I got a excellent customer service from Pfaltzgraff and they have exchanged the product.  Good advice, dont place them in the dishwasher
 I am an avid baker. Sometimes you need to whip up your egg whites to fold in later. Having an extra bowl makes this so much easier than transferring to a different type bowl. Or maybe you are making Christmas cookies - you can have one batter chilling in the fridge while you are mixing another one. It's well worth the money
 I bought this scale back in Jan or Feb. I needed one and after looking around for a while found that I liked this one the best because of its easy to read decimile display- pounds on one side, ounces (down to the tenth) on the other side. The lb/k switch is located on the bottom side of the unit and I don't find it inconvient down there. This scale also has a auto shutoff feature that helps save your batteries but has never shut off while I'm in the middle of measuring. Because of previous complaints to that effect when I first got mine I timed how long it would stay on ending up with close to 2.5 min before it did. I also love the look of the scale it is sleek and stylish, very clean lines and is easy to clean too, just a quick wipe down and I'm done. As a note to Alton Brown fans this is his scale of choice on Good Eats. The price tag may have you shying away but I assure you that its worth every penny. I would not trade mine for anything!
 I do a lot of stir frying, using one pan to do many dishes.  As a result I needed a pan that had non-stick quality for quick and easy cleaning and one that could take high heat from my professional stovetop.  When pan and oil are heated to the right temperature the interior 18/10 stainless steel surface behaved as if it were nonstick.  The heat was evenly conducted bottom through the sides, this due to the aluminium core sandwich being continuous from the bottom up the sides.  The sides are high enough to not have food spill out in the process of vigourous stir frying. The height is also good for small item deep frying.  The steep sloping of the sides enabled food to rotate well, falling back easily into the pan.  Quality pans tend to be heavy,  All Clad without exception but this size is perfectly manageable for tossing ingredients if need to.  It also cooks a generous portion for one to two persons.  All types(including metal) of utensils can be used with it.  This is a solid, handsome and versatile pan with wonderful easy care and use.  It is a total joy to cook with and one that gives you confidence that it will last a long, long time
 I first would like to say that if you are the occasional esspresso drinker, then this machine is to costly to use every once in a while go with a cheaper brand.

Now for the rest of you that are die hard esspresso drinkers this is the machine for you.I moved from AK to NY a few months ago, while I lived in AK (ALASKA) there were coffe shops on every corner, to say the least I was addicted to mochas, and moving to NY they are few and far between.  I was going into withdrawl.  After doing some research I found this great machine.  I wanted to use it for a while before writing a review about it.  I love this machine.  This machine is fast and the esspresso is great.  I am a fan of regular esspresso as well and it comes out at a consistanly high quality,  the Crema is perfect, however I found if you are using the single shot it doesn't come out that great so always use the double shot.  The machine heats up quickly and everything is provided for you, two cups, two saucers, a pitcher and a frothing attachment.  I can see that this machine will pay for itself withing no time.  I have owned cheaper models in the past and you can really tell the difference in the quality of the esspresso.  I have not used the pod attachment so I can't comment on that.  If you buy the machine in my opinion you wont be disappointed
 This timer screams quality!  Lovely, easy-to-use, and a great shriek to it. (you'll def hear it while in another part of the house!) One of its best features is that you can set the time just by tapping the particular numbers of the time needed. The best timer I've ever used or seen. I got two! :)This timer screams quality!

 I find this iron very easy to use.  The multiple steam holes makes ironing easier and faster.  I have a small problem with it spitting water.  I have tried using 1/2 tap and 1/2 spring water and I have tried adjusting the steam flow, but it still tends to spit.  Overall, I am very pleased with this iron. 
 This is a great iron.  It's quite heavy, but I like that.  It really gets out the wrinkles.  I don't even mind ironing any more
 Good knife, sharp, cuts well.  However, I'm partial to the KitcheAid  Chef's Knife. 
 I adore my Emile Henry pie dish.  It was my first piece of Emile Henry and worth every cent.  The dish is beautiful and durable.  It cleans up nicely, you don't have to worry about scratching and sticking is not a problem.  I adore my Emile Henry pie dish.  It was my first piece of Emile Henry and worth every cent.

Evenly cooked, no sticking, no burning.  For special occasion pies it is a huge asset.  Bringing a homemade apple pie to the table in a classic dish definitely ups the WOW factor.  In addition to the presentation value it bakes like a dream.  Crisp, even, golden crusts and bubbly filling.  Its also great with egg dishes like quiche that require very even heating for best results.  I baked stuffed sole in it tonight and the results were wonderful.

  It vacuums dog hair like nothing else I've used but you have to clean it every other time you use it. The cord could use 10' or so in additional length. The handle retracts nicely and it's light weight makes it easy to move around. I think the thing I like about it the most is the narrow suction strip or whatever it's called. I think the high power motor coupled with the narrow strip equates to superior suction but a little more time in use. This vacuum is totally worth the $60
 I am really pleased with this purchase. This cookware far exceeded my expectations. It's heavyweight but not too heavy. I just love the cool touch handles. I would recommend this set very highly. If you cook alot like I do you will be more than happy with this set.
 I have been very happy with this cookware. It is very well made, heavy and sturdy. This is the most expensive set I have ever bought, and the difference is stunning. The pans heat very quickly and get much hotter than my old pans.  I have had to change my cooking style to accommodate the better pans. I like being able to put them in the oven and not worrying about caring for a (possibly) toxic non-stick coating. Well worth the money
 I haven't had a chance to use them yet as the holidays are just approaching, but they look good and sturdy.  If the cheesecakes come out well, I'll know then, but so far, so good.  They delivered on time too.
 Farberware 18/10 stainless steel cookware is a good line. I had this cookware at one time, and I can recommend it, especially for use on gas burners. Unlike Calphalon cookware, it can go in the dishwasher. However, to keep the finish gleaming, you might need to scrub the pots and pans frequently with cleanser and scouring pads. The 8-Quart Stockpot with Lid is a kitchen essential
 So far this has been a great product. I've had it for about a year and a half and have used it almost every day to hold boiling water for making tea.  So far it has held up great.  This carafe keeps the water near boiling for at least 5 hours. When I leave the water in it for 24 hours, the water is still warm enough for me to make tea with it.So far this has been a great product.

 We received another set for our wedding, but I am considering taking it back to Macy's where this Calphalon 10 piece set was on sale for $399.00 this weekend.  Same set, same pieces!!  I can't believe it.  These pans feel great are durable but won't weigh you down while you are cooking--The analon advanced brand I got is so heavy!!  Yesterday, I paid $99.99 for just the 12 inch Calphalon fry pan and I feel it was worth it given how much I have used the 10 inch so far.  These are the only two pieces I have from this calphalon collection so far, but I want more.Oh and although they say not to use this particular nonstick line in the dishwasher, you'd be totally lazy if you had too because cleanup is so easy with these!!  It's amazing
 Saeco is  great full automatic esspreso cafe maker,with buildin grinder and automatic disposal best in class for pric
 For years we have used the Mr. Coffee Iced Tea makers and have purchased two of them.  This time around we chose to get the Hamilton Beach 40911 2-qt Iced Tea Maker.  Even though I/we haven't used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the Hamilton Beach method of brewing tea over the Mr. Coffee.  First of all the taste (using Luzianne Family Tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the Mr. Coffee makers.   Also one very large drawback with the Mr. Coffee maker is that the basket, for the bags, sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir, where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher.  Because Hamilton Beach placed the basket directly inside the Pitcher itself there is never any tea that finds its way into the bottom of the tea maker.  Also due to ridges in the bottom of the Mr. Coffee maker it's usually almost impossible to totally clean the pitcher and restore it back to the clean condition at the time you first used it.  This feature alone makes the Hamilton Beach a better buy over the Mr. Coffee but I thought, before my purchase, that surely the two would make equivalent tasting tea but using both Lipton and Luzianne Family Tea bags the Hamilton Beach not only brews the tea faster but the taste IS Better.  On the Mr. Coffee the strength of the tea is controlled by a sliding knob on the front of the maker whereas with the Hamilton Beach it is three rigid clicks of control on the bottom of the basket (mild, medium, strong), we usually use Medium.  For years we have used the Mr. Coffee Iced Tea makers and have purchased two of them.  This time around we chose to get the Hamilton Beach 40911 2-qt Iced Tea Maker.  Even though I/we haven't used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the Hamilton Beach method of brewing tea over the Mr. Coffee.  First of all the taste (using Luzianne Family Tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the Mr. Coffee makers.   Also one very large drawback with the Mr. Coffee maker is that the basket, for the bags, sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir, where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher.

We enjoy "Sweet-Tea" being from the South and anyone that makes good sweet tea knows you sweeten it while it's hot at the time of brewing.  Our method is to first fill the pitcher to the line and fill the reservoir and refill the pitcher to the same water level and then add 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups of sugar and stir with a whisk until very well mixed.  Once the tea is brewed you have to stir the tea again but you get perfect sweet tea every-time.  If you enjoy tea, even if you never considered an electric tea maker, the Hamilton Beach will be one purchase decision you will not regret.  Having two Mr. Coffee makers before this Hamilton Beach I don't see myself ever purchasing another Mr. Coffee unless they make many changes to their product and even then taste is the final decision maker.  I HIGHLY recommend the Hamilton Beach model and would gladly buy it again even if it was higher priced than the Mr. Coffee, it's totally worth it
 I am very impressed with this set. The pans are of heavy guage steel and have rolled edges.  I had 3 pounds of chicken on the cookie sheet and with a one handed lift the pan did not flex as my other pans did, again heavy guage steel.  The handles and the nonstick surface have had no problems at 450 degrees. Other brands that I have used deteriorate rapidly at 400 degrees or above. Keep in mind I am not a cook and by my very method of cooking (set oven to high and wait til you smell something burning) I am very hard on pans of any kind. A very high quality product that I would have gladly paid 50 bucks for. By the way, the cooling rack is nonstick as well.
 Very smooth operation. My complaint is that I have already spotted a bit of rust, but careful washing and drying should alleviate the problem
 I needed a set of knives like yesterday I had a [...] set of Chicago Cutlery knives they lasted 2 years the blades chipped and resharpen them were impossible because of the chipping, the handles faded and they had rust spots and I am not hard on knives I even hand washed them most of the time. So I bought these knives because they were Henckles and the never needed sharpening. I have had them 3 months they are perfect for me. they are made in China.

 Calling it short is a misnomer - it's not that short - it's an average size. It has a rather bulky handle that is comfortable to hold but difficult to store. The turner itself is a little on the thick side so lighter foods don't always want to cooperate but I'm pleased with it. I wouldn't buy a matching spoon becuase of the bulky handle - takes up too much room in my drawer
 With the advent of fancy featured coffee makers this is the right coffee maker for us.  We like to brew 1 large mug of coffee at a time so we have fresh tasting coffee.  Most models now have a carafe with the stop brew feature so you can pour out a cup while it is brewing.    But you must use their carafe.  With this maker you can use your own mug.  And if the carafe breaks (and it costs as much as the maker to replace sometimes) you can still use the maker with the mug or other container.  I sometimes use a stainless steel pitcher.  Sure this maker isn't fancy, but I just want a simple cup of coffee and this maker does it with an appliance that doesn't take up lots of counter space.  I haven't had any problems with messes or clean up with this maker
 We bought this sweeper instead of the Dyson, because con. report had it rated higher. We paid a lot less and we are very happy with this product
 I've had lots of coffemakers over the years, and always had a problem pouring the coffee into a cup. It ran over the side and made a mess, unless you poured it very slowly. I saw this model a few years ago and decided to try it. It is great. I will never own anything else. I have been looking for one to replace my old one, only because the heating element is dirty/rusty looking (my wife doesn't like it). In fact I'm going to buy one right now on Amazon, as I've looked at a few stores and the new Black and Decker models I have seen,don't have the dripless pouring spout
 This coffee maker is so simple to use any husband can do it!  And, it makes a mighty fine cup of Joe at that!  Shipping was free, and it arrived in perfect shape in a timely matter.  Highly recommended
 These oval dishes are just the right size for sides, and they stay warm a very long time besides looking great. I have served mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, all kinds of squash and even bay and sea scallops; everything looks better in these. Also bought several for my children. A fine addition to your Le Creuset collection
 What can you say about a blender?Pros: Easy to clean, attractive, very powerfulCons: LOUD. The lid doesn't fit well
 This model is an improvement over the older pot shape. It is easier to clean and use. I wish it was available in local stores. I had to order it online which means extra for shipping
 This is a fantastic idea for teaballs. Sleek and stylish, this set is also practical.This is a fantastic idea for teaballs. Sleek and stylish, this set is also practical.The two teaballs are spring-loaded, and perfectly sized for a single cup of tea. Simply press the plunger, then stir the ball around in your loose tea container. Lift it out of the tea and shake the excess out to level the tea. Let go of the plunger, and the teaball closes securely. The long stem on the balls allow you to take the ball out of your cup (or stir the tea as it's brewing, if that's your preference) without having to lift a hot chain off of the side of your cup of hot water.The two teaballs are spring-loaded, and perfectly sized for a single cup of tea.

The problem with the spoon is that to fill it with tea, you have to hold it vertically in the container, which means you have few options - either close the spoon while the tea is still sticking out the sides, and fill your cup with loose tea, or try to shake the extra tea out after you pull the spoon of the container, and get tea all over your counter.

The good design is that below where each teaball hangs, there is a significant 'bowl' to catch any tea that might still be dripping. This has proven to be a very handy feature. The tower itself isn't very mobile, however. Due to how the hooks hold the teaball stems, it is seemingly impossible to move without one of the balls falling out. Also, when I got mine, the tower was visibly crooked, and I had to bend it back straight. That worked for me, but was quite hard, and I was worried I'd break it.The tower has one interesting feature, but some shortcomings.

 I love these oven mitts.  They have a magnet in them so you can stack them one on top of the other and stick them to your oven or refrigerator, or other metal surface.  They are not as cumbersome as the really long, heavily molded ones.  I bought them for all of my grown children and they all love them too. 
 I have been using the coffee maker for over 3 months now, and I love it! I like that I can use either the caraffe or the travel mugs.
 I have had this for almost a year, and for the money I cannot recommend a better product. I would buy another
 In my opinion:In my opinion:Well, I ordered two of these, one for my Daughter. Since I had two, guess what I did? You're right - I tested both on the same hot and cold materials to see how close they read. Well, they were within 1/2 degree F. of each other, which in a laboratory is sloppy, but for cooking food, it's darn accurate. Well, I ordered two of these, one for my Daughter.

Well, they were within 1/2 degree F. of each other, which in a laboratory is sloppy, but for cooking food, it's darn accurate. I have several oven thermometers, you know, the mechanical ones, and I use this unit to see how accurate they are. Also, I wanted a thermometer to be able to check the temperature of thinner foods, such as a hamburger, chicken patty, chicken breasts. Now, as you know, when you check the temperature of these items, you want a really quick reading, because your hand is close to the heat. Well, it's not as quick as advertised. It will take about 8 to 10 seconds to get a good reading, but that's not terribly long. Make sure you slide the temp probe through the handle so that your hand can be even further away from the fire.Also, I wanted a thermometer to be able to check the temperature of thinner foods, such as a hamburger, chicken patty, chicken breasts.

For food preparation, the difference would have no meaning.

I've bought others, including those ridiculous forks with the built-in thermometers, but this unit is the best
 When I ordered this saucepan, I didn't realize how high the quality would be.  When I opened the box and first lifted the saucepan, I was immediately impressed with the weight and quality.  Each time that I use this pan to heat up foods, I am constantly surprised at how much less time it takes for those foods to cook.  Water boils very quickly.  Lastly, the engraved measuring lines for liquids are  extremely helpful.  All in all, the best saucepan that I've owned
 I really like the hampers.  They don't take up a lot of floor space and with three, I can separate the laundry.  The handles make it easy to move them.  They are a little deeper than my arms are long (I'm short) but I can tilt them to empty them.  Would have liked having an assortment of colors to choose from
 My boyfriend and I live in a two room apartment. There is not a lot of storage space. I ordered two of these hampers and the first one just came. I put his clothes in and he still has half of the hamper left. I am so glad to get something that is sturdy and large now we will have a place to put our clothes. 
 The most important quality of this tea pot is that it pours well; it does not drip nor does the water overflow the spout when filling the pot. I am very happy with my purchase
 These sheets feel like you want them too. Heavy and soft. Worth every penny. This is the second time I've bought them from Amazon I can't see any reason to buy any other kind
 I just recently purchased this little knife set at a local department store and paid $10.00 for the set. I love these things! At Amazon's price of $3.99 I added a second set to another order and I am eagerly awaiting their arrival. I would recommend these knives to anyone.  They are such a good deal, in my opinion
 The vacu vin wine saver works great, it keeps wine fresh in the refrigerator for weeks. Also it is very easy to use
 This is the only grill I've ever had, so I guess I can't compare it to others, but for me this grill has been just great.  It is super easy to use and clean.  It has given me no problems at all.  I recommend it
 Have to say "ditto" to all the reviewers below--I owned another brand before but it wasn't nearly as powerful.  At least one reviewer expresses concern about keeping the blades clean, so I must note that the instructions indicate everything but the motor housing--which detaches from the blade element--can go in the dishwasher!
 I'm sticking with the lighter colors due to scratching.  My persimmon 16 piece setting arrived with two dinner plates scratched.  I think next time I'll order them as individual place settings as they weren't packed well.  Amazon will give me a 20% discount for keeping them. 
 This is my favorite knife. It cuts very nicely and has a great feel. Mine is still sharp after 2 years of use
 I bought this egg cooker as a gift for my son, but I have used it and really like it.  It soft boiled the eggs perfectly and is also very convenient to clean.  The timer is also loud enough to hear
 Had this oven for about a month now, and very satisfied. Nice brushed stainless steel finish, solid construction. Was a bit larger than I anticipated, but still fits nicely on my countertop. The controls could be a bit more elegantly designed, but overall very pleased with this oven. My favorite thing about it is how FAST it cooks and toasts
 This cake form is phenominal!  After spaying it with the flour/butter Pam, my cakes are flawless.  I have never been disappointed with how my cakes have turned out with this pan.  Not one corner of the pattern was soft.  Every detail comes out crisp and so very clean.  I have bought other pans from this maker and only have good things to say about them
 I love this pan. It's a 10 + in my eyes.  When it arrived I washed it with mild soap and water.  Dried it, sprayed cooking spray and filled it with my cake batter and popped it in the preheated oven.  37 minutes later a gorgeous cake was baked.  I turned the pan over on a wire rack and my cake fell right out without one crumb stuck in the pan.  I'm going to give this pan as gifts in the future.  This cake design is especially lovely when you dust the cake with powdered sugar and cinnamon..............
 I used La Cloche to make bread with, specifically San Francisco Sourdough, with SPECTACULAR results. The crust was crisp but chewey, and I could not imagine baking another loaf without it. But after I used it the first time, the bottom developed a crack. After a second use, the crack became so large that I will not use it again for fear it will break during cooking.I used La Cloche to make bread with, specifically San Francisco Sourdough, with SPECTACULAR results.

Their customer service was outstanding, and I feel they build a quality product. I also purchased the rectangular version of La Cloche, and I have not had an issue. Perhaps our La Cloche was damaged during shipping. I would have rated it 5 stars otherwise
 I love to bake.  I really love to bake bread.  My specialty is sourdough.  So now I have 3 strikes against me, that is, until I found La Cloche.  I love to bake.  I really love to bake bread.  My specialty is sourdough.  So now I have 3 strikes against me, that is, until I found La Cloche.  Although it can be used to cook meats, I personally only use it for bread.  La Cloche turns your regular oven into a brick oven, and the quality of your bread will amaze you.  It browns beautifully, has a crispy, chewy crust that seems to carmelize the sugars in the crust differently.  There is no need to spray water or create steam in the oven, because the steam is created inside La Cloche by the bread itself.

I have both and pop them into the oven at the same time, so I am baking 2 loaves of bread at once, which is a little more economical.

All my other bread pans are now unused
 First of all, they aren't really intended for the novice user, but they are perfect for the long run. The wooden ones WILL rot before you ever get skilled with them, but these stainless steel ones will take a licking and keep on picking.First of all, they aren't really intended for the novice user, but they are perfect for the long run.

Apparently they're quite popular in Korean households...as well as stainless steel rice bowls.  You might have seen them, the ones with the stainless lids?Anyway.  These are just like the ones I grew up using.  There are some drawbacks (like the noodle comment made earlier) but it's not a product flaw.  Yes, wooden chopsticks are going to grip better, but they also tend to mildew if used repeatedly and have to be restocked.  Lacquer coated wooden chopsticks tend to flake after a while.  And besides, when eating asian food you don't really pick up individual noodles (which would have you slipping and sliding).  You sorta grab a large portion and bring your face close to the bowl and slurp them down.  I think the Japanese actually bring the bowl to their face instead.

 I have this and mini-pans and muffin pans - all silicone. They are great. The biggest problem is that the bread tends to expand the sides of the soft pan so the sides are a bit wider. I never oil the pans and the bread pops out easily. The muffins too ususally since the recipe often has oil in it.I have this and mini-pans and muffin pans - all silicone. They are great.

 A wonderful product.  Everything cooks very evenly.  No sticking.  So easy to wash and store also
 I've had this model of the Shark for a couple of months now and it is working great. It has a powerful suction compared to my Duster Buster. I have had no problems with the battery so far and it seems to last the adertised 15 minutes. I too concerned over the HEPA filters.  You can do a decent job cleaning it and I plan to clean it well with my ShopVac to extend the life. The vacuum and accessories fit nicely into the stand. I would definitely recommend this product for quick vaccums around the house and in the car
 My husband drinks coffee continuously. Whenever we are in the car, I'm always after him not to spill his coffee and I constantly have to clean up the inevitable spills. We could never find a good cup that would fit in the cup holder so the spills were always on the floor or in his lap. This cup does spill if it's tipped over (I don't think any cup will ever be completely spill proof) but it fits in the cup holder and therefore doesn't spill as easily. I bought two, one for him and one for me (I drink ice water and tea) and they both fit together nicely side-by-side in our cars cup holder. They keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for long periods of time. I have purchased loads of cups over the 34 years of our marriage and this has to be the best by far. I would highly recommend this item for everyone!
 I really wanted a 5-quart pot and wouldn't want to spend a lot of $$$.  This turned out to be a great buy.  It is a very good quality product.  The non-stick surface seems very well coated.  It's very versatile for us (a family of 4).  I am very pleased and satisfied with the product

 Having read the other reviews of this product on this site, I decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered.  I ordered three of these products from this site, and when they arrived, not a single one of them worked - at all.  They were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested, these products are completely useless.  Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged.  Thus, your credit card will still be billed, your dogs will still be barking, and you may get stuck with products that are worthless.     
 Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.
 This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time
 Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want"
 I bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier. He didn't even notice it was there. I put it near his crate and it still didn't stop him from barking.  I pushed the manual button and still nothing.  It promises to stop annoying barking, but it didn't stop my dog for one minute.  It was a complete waste of my money
 Our dogs didn't even notice it.  We have three small terriers and I thought this would be a suitable device for a few house slippers.  I was wrong - the kept on barking..
 Read the description carefully. It states the speaker range is 50' not the microphone. My dog stood 10' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn't trigger. Matter of fact I never could get it to trigger with barking. The only time it did go off was when I put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand. Even then it didn't go off till I was about 4 feet from the mower.Read the description carefully. It states the speaker range is 50' not the microphone.

 I have had my Super Bark Free for 3 years. Never really worked the way I hoped but I spent so much on it I keep trying. Well now it doesn't work. Can't turn it off and it doesn't cycle when the dog barks.I have had my Super Bark Free for 3 years. Never really worked the way I hoped but I spent so much on it I keep trying. Well now it doesn't work. Can't turn it off and it doesn't cycle when the dog barks.I called Lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period "1 year" they would just replace it. I told him I was willing to pay to have it repaired. He said, "We are just the distributor and don't support repairs of our product. That is the key, "THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT"
 Super Bark Free didn't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor's dog's extremely irritating ear-piercing loud barking - he merely ignored it (though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet). I'm mad that I wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product.Super Bark Free didn't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor's dog's extremely irritating ear-piercing loud barking - he merely ignored it (though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet).

And in the meantime, shop around for a more effective product
 The one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn't! This thing blows more air than it sucks dirt. What a useless thing. I'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor. This thing certainly doesn't do it! If you're looking to buy this thing, look again -- there MUST be something better if not just your regular broom
 The design for using the DC adapter with LED Booklight is extremely poor. It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.The design for using the DC adapter with LED Booklight is extremely poor.

 i got this fryer only yesterday i fryed some chicken wings and french fries the fries came out with so much oil and cooked for 10 min for a small batch i have been frying for about 10 years and know how to cook very well and i have to say this is just as bad as frying on the stove. i put the oil to the max fill line and with cooking the two things the oil went down to the min line do not buy.
 There are a lot of theoretically good ideas that  fail when executed. This is one of them. 1/QUALITY:It's made cheaply, and even before it breaks, it's flimsiness does not inspire confidence. 2/RESISTANCE:The levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks,(many will be unchallenged right from the beginning). The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There's a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually  helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by  claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle  lying down (??) to do crunches is, we've reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT. It seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort. Unfortunately, exercise IS effort, and the more you avoid effort, the less exercise you get
 I have seen this online on other sites and in catalogs for $20 (not on sale either - regular price). Same siz
 The Corningware dish is great, my 1 star is not for the item, it is for Dynadirect.  They are HORRIBLE!  Item was backordered, but they never told me and charged my credit card.  When I called they finally told me it was backordered and I ask that they cancel the order and refund my money.  Bad, Bad Servic
 I was really hopeful about this product working.  I have four dogs, ages 2 through 8.  I tried and tried to teach them how to use this product, but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button.  They just ignored the paw and wouldn't ever put their paw on it to even touch it
 This is very misleading. this item is only half of the package. after its delivered you will find that you must also order more parts to make it work. very disappointed in amazon for allowing this
 As this is a consumable food product, I'd like to know what each color is made of.  ???????????
 I am very disappointed.  These flowers are worse than what you see at a grocery store.  I ended up paying more from another vendor and getting flowers that she liked.  I buy roses alot, and I know what a fair cost is for good quality.  If you're paying less than $30, beware
 Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me.  I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!  I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes & Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light
 Why does this light cost 30$? For this price and supposedly a bunch of "design awards", I find this light to be of extremely poor quality. The connection between the chord and the a/c adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension. The chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on. I am still looking for a better alternative, but for the price, this light isn't worth the investment.
 I bought this for my mother-in-law at her request.  She has arthritis and saw it on TV.  She also wanted the free gripper that came with it.  I scoured the listings at Amazon looking for one that included the gripper, even paid a little more for it.  She used the can opener once and it broke.  The "free" gripper required sending away for it and an inflated S&H fee
 The can has to be 100% dent free for this to work.  If you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can, this thing won't open your product.  A great idea, but this needed a little more refinement.The can has to be 100% dent free for this to work.

 I bought these towels to wash my car, so I wanted a thick soft 100% cotton nap.  What I received was on par with the thin towels you'd find at cheap hotel - not thick or soft.  On the plus side, the sewed in tag did say 100% cotton and it was made in the USA
 This product does separate the fat BUT small bits of meat or vegetables will stop up the spout and the plastic is not heat resistant. Mine cracked the first time I used it and after the second use it had to go in the trash can
 Once upon a time, not too long ago, they made and sold fat separators that permitted the juice to flow out from the bottom of the separator. This meant that the cook could harvest all of the juice, plus the tasty bits,  instead of, as with this product, having to strain the sauce first (for the  bits) and then sacrifice some of the sauce (a small amount to be sure),  lest the fat start to flow through the spout as well. This product is  really just a step away from spoon and ice cube, and not a big step,  considering that it's not a complete solution. If the cooks's purpose were  to collect the fat--e.g., chicken schmalz--free from juices, it would  present the same problems
 Works well on carpets not to well anywhere else.  The hose attachment is horrible, the hose is about 4 ft long and stiff and is not permanently attached to the vacuum, and when you try to clean furniture the movement losens it and it comes off.  I have 2 dogs and 3 cats and I need to be able to clean the furniture.  Also when you could use the hose on something all the dirt piled up on the floor where the vacuum stood, it was not pulled into the bag. Very disappointed with it and would not recommend to anyone with pets. 
 The International Eversharp line is Henckels low-end, stamped stainless line.  It is not carbon steel. It is not hand-forged.  It does not compare to the other Henckels lines which are.

 I decided to give this product a shot. Some reviewers said the bags would work properly if you don't overstuff them -- still not true! A Large bag re-inflated when I put 2 standard pillows in it. So I took out 1 pillow and tried again, and the bag was nowhere near being full. It seemed to work all right, but the next morning the pillow had re-inflated! And if you buy the bags with the zippers, the zippers come off easily, they make sealing more difficult, and one even tore a hole in the bag. I purchased straight from AsSeenOnTV.com, but their return policy looks a little weird. I'm not sure if I'll get a refund. Also be careful if you order straight from AsSeenOnTV.com -- I upgraded to express shipping and got my package 12 days later! I guess the product was just too good to be true.
 This is the worst basting brush I have ever encountered.  At first countless bristles fell out in my food and every time I washed it.  (Although it's dishwasher safe, it failed to come clean in there, even after a big squirt of dawn and much hand washing it isn't spotless, but I think I pulled most of the loose bristles out in the process.)  It also doesn't stand up to any heat, I use it to lightly grease my griddle for pancakes and things (at about 375 degrees) becuase I don't like the residue left by Pam, and it shrinks and flakes bristle bits every time.  I also don't like the Good Grips in general (these were a gift) the handles are too bulky and take up too much space in my utensil crock and limited apartment kitchen drawers
 The Fiestaware Scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous.  The handle is much too small for this size mug.  If you can get your finger through the small hole, your finger will soon be as scarlet as the Fiestaware.  The first and only time my family used these mugs, two of us burned ourselves.

 Last year, I bought a Pizza Stone from Pampered Chef.  It was a rousing success with my family.  For the 5 of us, however, one stone was not enough and I wanted a companion that would help provide two delicious pizzas at one time.  Sadly, the product did not come through.  My pizza stuck to the stone and had to be scraped off.  I tried going against the directions and didn't preheat the stone the second time.  It stuck even worse!  The pizza didn't get fully done in the middle, while the Pampered Chef pizza was perfect both times.  I will be throwing the stone away and ordering the higher priced alternative from Pampered Chef.  You get what you pay for!!
 I thought I was getting a true cooking stone - but it is only a bread stone.  Cannot cook other foods on it. I thought I was getting something similar to pampered chef cooking stone where I could cook meat, cookies, etc. and it seasoned the stone as it was used.  If all you want is pizza or bread this may be the item - but it is VERY limited in use for the amount of space it takes up in the cabinet. 
 Purchased the unit about 6 months ago and have never been happy with it. The heating plate under the pot started to rust; the pot leaks every time it's poured; it's almost impossible to pour water into the water chamber without spilling it; the handle of the coffee basket broke within a few months; and two days ago the entire top of the unit snapped off when we opened it to pour in the water. We purchased this unit because of the Cuisinart brand and the stainless steel carafe. We will not purchase another
 I have a Kitchenaid model K5SSWH Heavy Duty Mixer and they do not fit over my 5 qt bowl.  I regrettably only read the editorial review and bought these covers thinking I can snap them on. I use them to loosely cover my attachments now, but I could have used anything for that
 As Shannon says, Kitchenaid mixer bowl covers are terrific for storing food and attachments.  But be warned: these particular covers may not fit your mixer bowl!  I purchased a new Artisan mixer &amp; ordered these to go along with it, but they are too small.  They do not fit the Artisan or KSM90 mixer bowls.  Models they fit are KBC5N, K5SS, &amp; KSM5 only
 Started having problems with hot water spraying out and burning those who stand in front. Contacted Melitta and they said they are aware of the issue and I have to "purchase" a pod holder adapter due to the pods are too thick. I questioned charging people for something they manufactured and were notified was defective, the dummy on the phone didn't have an answer. I do not recommend this product. Maybe a class action is due
 I ordered this after reading that it "includes 6 18 ounce bowls". This is bad advertising. I ordered 2 sets and only received 2 bowls.  After I wrote to customer service and asked for the additional 10 bowls per the offer.  Amazon refused to send them and thanked me for "pointing out an error".  In 2 days Amazon has not even corrected the ad. Beware of this product and offer and know that Amazon has not made good on its offer. I have ordered many products from this site, but will be more skeptical in the future, and will only order an item if it is an individual item with a name brand that I can track
 I am a big fan of espresso and espresso drinks but needed to save money so I bought this to make it at home. Making espresso is easy enough if you follow the instructions (I didn't watch the video). The frother even works well. The problem I had was with the flavor. The manual suggests making two or four shots of espresso at a time, but when making four shots the espresso was badly burned by the time it was finished brewing. I had best results making just over one shot at a time, but the flavor was still burned and flat. In the end, I used the machine for a couple months but eventually put it away and went back to my regular drip coffee maker

 the cofee carafe keeps brew hot for hours! I have had 4 spillages and alot of mess to clean up because the filter must be aligned properly or else! I also cannot figure out how to program... one of the most important features for me buying...  I really wish I could send this back
 Despite my by-the-book care of these knives, I still get rust stains that are nearly impossible to get off.  I do not have that problem with other knives in my collection, but these clean up like cheap steel.  Not very attractive, and you don't want to eat with them
 Love those Irobot products and everything they're capable of doing.  In fact, this was my third purchase, but my first remanufactured product.  What a headache!  The product worked correctly just three times, then died. Both technical support and customer service from Irobot were helpful and prompt, but still took weeks to resolve the issues. I tried a different way of recharging, which didn't work.  Then they replaced the battery, but that still didn't solve the problem.  Ultimately I had to send the product back, then waited more than a month for a replacement, which was on backorder.  Finally, they substituted a different model, and which works just as advertised.  I'd never buy another remanufactured model.  But I still believe in Irobot.
 Fiesta Scarlet is a beautiful color and the Sugar and Creamer with Tray is really great.  Mine arrived broken and I had difficulty returning it so I remain disappointed and unwilling to try again.
 Please note that I have several Henckel knives that I really like, so this is definitely not a anti-Henckel biased review.Please note that I have several Henckel knives that I really like, so this is definitely not a anti-Henckel biased review.There is really only one problem with this knife - the blade is way too thick.  If there's only one problem - then why do I give it only one star?  Well, this one problem completely ruins this knife.  The 'eversharp' name I'm sure refers to the fact that the serrations are not the standard "wave pattern" you'd see on most bread knives. Instead, each serration has several smaller serrations and spikes built in. I know that this is supposed to ensure that the knife will never end up dull - but in the process it makes it horrible at doing any kind of delicate cutting. Plus, the blade is not flexible in any way due to the extreme thickness. Unless you are cutting the sturdiest bread out there, you'll crush it while trying to slice with this blade. Forget about cutting any kind of soft bread or pastry. I've found that some of our cheap steak knives work far better than this knife.There is really only one problem with this knife - the blade is way too thick.

The first was a Paderno (small Canadian company) that we got for our wedding, and the second was a Global bought from Amazon. Both are considerably more expensive than this knife, but there are other, more economical options out there that are still far better. You want to find a nice, thin blade with even and sharp serrations. If you're looking to stay in this price range, you won't find anything forged - these will all be stamped or laser cut - but that's fine - the bread knife doesn't need to be strong like your chef's knife.I've come to the conclusion that this knife is horrible after comparing it to two other bread knives I now own.

 Terrible ergonomics!  It was SO difficult and uncomfortable to keep the trigger engaged and carve at the same time.  My hand was ACHING by the time I'd carved the brisket.  I've never used a more awkward or uncomfortable appliance
 This grill is better in theory than practice.  I'm not sure it heats to the temp it shows on the display and it really isn't practical for steaks except very thin ones.  It's pretty handy for hamburgers and also makes good panini sandwiches.  I haven't tried some of the other recipes so I can't really comment on anything else.  It is easy to clean, so that's a plus
 The only thing this juicer is good for is to find out if you will really be into juicing.  This juicer lasted for 3 months while juicing 3 to 5 times a week (for two people).  At 3 months the tray that holds the blade warped and started spitting plastic into the drink.  I considered getting another one to have spare parts....then I scraped that idea and got a real juicer.  Besides being cheaply made...it should also be priced cheaper.  Also the blade takes a while to clean
 and when i requested a  return amazon said they would send me a return label, but didn't.  nor did they respond to my email advising i never received the return label.  this is my last order from amazon
 I felt disapointed with the quality of this bake set. The grill cover started to desapair, and the last time I cooked a stek using this set, the paint sticked to the meat, leaving black spots. It started to show deteriorazion and everytime I washed I have to dried it up immediately otherwise mark of rust starts to show soon.The deep pan it is ok, perhaps because I did not used that piece with the same frequency.I never used metal utensills or harsh detergents durig the cleaning, I always leave it in hot water first and later do the cleaning, to avoid scratches.Thank you for your attentionNilda
 Purchased this set and on the first use the non-stick finish, started peeling off.  Not worth buying
 The temperature markings on this thermometer are not protected!  Over time the markings get occluded by grease and if you try to wash the grease off the markings come with it. This means the thermometer has a short life span for people who rely on the markings for anything (which granted is not everyone).  Last time I buy an oven thermometer in which the markings don't sit behind a glass face!

 I was looking for a springform pan for a particular recipe that called for 3&quot; sides.  I was delighted when I saw that you had one so I ordered it. The item was misrepresented as the sides are like any other springform with 2&quot; sides.  I am sure it is a good pan , but it didnot meet my expectations
 I just bought this fan and it is too loud! Even on its lowest setting, the noise is a bit much. It does put out a stiff breeze, but I'm not sure it's worth it. My Black and Decker tower fan is better
 Had to return the first one because of a lock malfunction (it locked but would not unlock).  Amazon was great about responding immediately and replacing it promptly.  However, the lock on the second one does not work properly, either (it doesn't lock), though I will keep it, since keeping little hands safe is not an issue in my home. This item is a good way of storing blades and disks, but unless Cuisinart comes up with a more reliable locking mechanism, don't count on it to protect small hands from getting into it. 
 I've heard of others complaining that these probes will end up failing under "normal" use... something goes wrong at some point, and they just don't read right anymore.I've heard of others complaining that these probes will end up failing under "normal" use... something goes wrong at some point, and they just don't read right anymore.I love my Taylor digital thermometer, and these probes seem to work with the Taylor, but I went through 3 probes very quickly. I use them in my Weber barbeque when doing indirect heat cooking. In spite of the fact that I took care to not route the cable over a burner, or anything of that sort, each probe lasted only 5 or 6 uses.I love my Taylor digital thermometer, and these probes seem to work with the Taylor, but I went through 3 probes very quickly.

 When our wonderful Cuisanart four-slice toaster finally died, we replaced it with this horrible piece of junk, because it seemed most similar to the old one.

 The toast was black on setting 4, black and dark tan on setting 3, and dark tan and untoasted on setting 2. This is appalling performance for such an expensive toaster, and not worthy of Cuisinart
 I purchased one like this last December.On the 13th month I owned it it began to leak from the spout.I emailed Breville 2-3 times and they never even responded!Their web site states they always respond within 3 days.Don't believe them and don't buy a product from this company

 You truly get what you pay for in this case.  We bought the red ones and they have left fuzzies all over the house.  In the dryer, you need to check the lint trap frequently, as they shed like mad.  They are not smooth and cozy, they have a very high coefficient of friction and it's sorta hard to scootch around on them.  I would not recommend. 
 Product not even worth a penny. Impossible to use after the first wash..Wont recommend to anyon

 When it works, this blender does a fine job, and looks great.  However, our first one quit turning the blades in less than a year. We sent it in, after MANY calls to customer service, and they kept the darned thing for 3 months before deciding to send us a replacement.  The replacement lasted only 2 years before the blades broke.  During that 2 years, we figured out that our extra set of blades didn't fit in bottom ring properly, and allowed fluid to pour through the motor.  Great.  I should have save up to buy a vitamix instead
 On 8/15/06, I purchased and Irobot Roomba Scheduler. Within one month of purchase, it failed completely and would not work at all. On the Irobot website, it claims that their customer service department is open 24/7, and they guarantee a reply to an email within 24 hours. I sent an email, and I never heard anything back from them at all. After a week, I called their technical support line, and I waited on hold for 38 minutes before being able to speak to a technician, who swiftly determined that my unit was defective and needed to be replaced. I was told to mail in my defective unit and that another one would be shipped to me. It is now 11/9/2006 and I have received nothing and heard nothing from Irobot. DO NOT PURCHASE ONE OF THESE UNITS UNLESS THIS KIND OF PRODUCT UNRELIABILITY AND ABYSMAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS APPEALING TO YOU.
 At first I was pretty happy with the grater, but after a few days of use I started to notice that I was getting small shavings of metal as well as shredded cheese. I am no longer using it and would not recomend it to anyone
 Well, I'm not terribly impressed with this metal rotary grater.  Yes, it will grate cheese, but the gap between the drum and compartment that holds the cheese is a little over 1/4 of an inch.  This allows for the cheese to get 'gummed' up and eventually that large wad just falls through.  Also, for harder cheeses this means you're constanty picking out chunks of cheese that should have been grated.Well, I'm not terribly impressed with this metal rotary grater.

I've broken several plastic models within 2 days of owning them.  While I've yet to break this metal model, it just doesn't perfrom very well.  I'm still using my stand-up grater
 I bought this to replace my old Mouli grater which finally bit the dust.  Big mistake.  It is sturdy and reasonably well designed, but  the grating surfaces barely work at all, or at least mine didn't.  To get it to grate cheese takes a long time and a lot of muscle, so much so that you are likely to start wondering how badly you really want the grated cheese.  I tried the grater drum on reasonably fresh Parmesan and later tried the shredder drum on Jarlsberg.  Neither drum worked satisfactorily. That may be because it is made in China where hard western-style cheese is nearly unknown.  Yeah I  know it says MIU France but the box clearly says "Made in China".  I finally got so mad I threw it out in frustration
 I HAVE THE ARTISAN KITCHENAID MIXER AND THIS COVER IS TOO BULKY FOR IT. IT IS TOO LONG AT THE BOTTOM AND JUST UNPLEASING TO THE EYE. WOULD RECOMMEND JUST LEAVING YOUR MIXER UNCOVERED. HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL
 Well, I just got my blender, real excited to use it, filled it up with the ingredients, flipped on the switch , and within 5 seconds it started smoking, badly, and then died.  I turned it off and tried to turn it on again, and all it did was make a grumbly noise.  So I am sending it back and sticking with my old Hamilton that I have had for 9 years.  Why did I quit using it in the first place.  $20 blender and it made a perfect smoothie.  $79 for this Waring and it crashed and burned on me.  My advice is it looks nice, but it isn't worth the money, especially since it died right away on me.  Oh well...
 When I bought this item I attempted to test it in hot water. My only comparison was another grocery store thermometer which wasn't accurate.  It appeared to register better than the grocery store model.  However, when using it to make chocolate fudge, by the time it registered 225 degree's, the fudge was thickening in the pan, not a pretty sight.  I used it correctly and it has been stored according to manufacturers direction.  It has a 5 year Limited Warranty for replacement.  I don't feel it's worth the trouble to send back as I don't want another of this brands products, ever.  It's going in the garbage as I attempt to find an accurate, well calibrated candy thermometer
 Got this product by mistake from Chef's tools.  Grinding mechanism is made of plastic and it does not grind pepper.  Have the Black Magnum and is the best peppermill ever, (thats why we wanted a second one for the kitchen).  Our black peppermill did not come from Chef's tools
 Discount any review of a blender that reflects only several months of use.  As a smoothie addict, shoveling a dozen or more ice cubes into the jar daily, I'm still looking for a machine that can go the distance (is a full year's use asking too much?).  The Braun burned out in the first 90 days, faster than my Black and Decker, Oster, even Hamilton Beach (though it lasted longer than Back to the Basics).  The best thing I can say for the Braun is that it doesn't have the impossible-to-clean push buttons (always look for a single switch, a knob, or a touch-pad).  Otherwise, their shavers have served me better, mowing down whiskers more dependably than ice cubes.Discount any review of a blender that reflects only several months of use.

 This citrus juicer has a very good external design. The problem is that 30W is not enough power for doing the job well: normal orange presure stops de motor! The transmission of the power is done by cheap plasic parts, so they broke easily. These parts broke after a dozen of uses in my case, so I do not recommend this machine.
 Ok...so this isnt a review,but a question I have on this product. Where is the instruction manual to this thing? What do the lines above the alcohol names mean. There are two, three, even four lines above some of the alcohol names. Does it mean the amount of alcohol that is supposed to be put into that particular drink. Please answer...for it has left many of us flustered. thank you very muc
 This mixer runs too fast, even in it's lowest setting.  The beaters tend to throw food out of the mixing bowl. Uncontrolable.  Would not suggest purchasing

 While seeing this pasta bowl on sale for $4.99 here at Amazon.com, I didn't think twice to purchase several of them will all kind of color availalbe 2 weeks ago. What a great price! I was so excited and waiting on the door on the schedule delivery day. The packing is nice and secure. The color was so vivid at the first sight, but.... after I took a hard look, almost half of the bowls are defective!! Un-colored white spot, un-glazed bubble holes, black dots/stain inside of the bowl. Even defective spots are tiny, but they are so obvious. They just don't look good with those flaws on them! I was so....disappointed and frustrated as I went through all the 21 bowls I ordered. By the way, the BLACK bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl. I will say those are probably the factory-secondary products. It turned out I have to return almost half of the bowls and keep those bowls with bearable defectiveness, such as vague stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls. Of course, all the black ones are returned since they are no-name with the bad quality. No one will even believe they are Fiestaware!!
 Tired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice, I was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently.  No such luck with this one! First, it uses a different measuring system for the rice ("rice cooker cup")than it does for the water ("regular measuring cup"), so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it's back to guesswork again! Worse though, is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed, so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam. For those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great. One might figure out how to adjust the measuring, but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output. Since water boils at the same temperature, fast or slow, it makes no sense.Yet another gripe is that it automatically goes into "warm" mode when it is finished. May be handy to have the warm option, but if you don't realize it's done and its left on "warm" for ten minutes the rice turns into a solid slab.It seems very well made, and handsome Bau-Haus design, but unfotrtunately I can't use it because of the above problems. It seems very well made, and handsome Bau-Haus design, but unfotrtunately I can't use it because of the above problems. Others' experience may vary. Keep in mind I'm very good at ruining rice.

 I hardly ever write reviews but I felt the need to on this item. I bought the senseo deluxe last night, I wanted the deluxe model so that I could also make tea. The setup was quick and easy and the price was great compared to the competition. Here's the problem, I brewed a cup of coffee and this was the weakest coffee EVER and I'm not even a big coffee drinker. To make matters worse each pod only makes 4oz of coffee. Who drinks only 4 ounces of anything. You would need to use 2 pods just to make 8 oz and then the coffee is still weak. Which is wear the waste of money comes in. The senseo pods are the same price as the home cafe pods but you will go through them twice as fast. I personally ended up returning this machine and getting a tassimo this morning. I originally bought the Senseo because I didnt want to spend Tassimo money but in the end you pay for what you get. Now the tassimo is great. I've made hot chocolate for my daughter and tea for my son. Everyone likes it. Good luck everyone. 
 This was an excellent item...for about 3 uses...then the mandoline would not hold to one thickness...it keeps opening up to maximum cut depth.   MIU France says this is not their problem..."just buy a new one".  With an attitude like that...and product failure so quickly.....yes, I will buy a different brand...and avoid MIU France product
 It's too bad ... I really wanted this to work, since I love soft serve. But after using it twice I donated to Goodwill.It's too bad ... I really wanted this to work, since I love soft serve. But after using it twice I donated to Goodwill.It would be great if somebody brought out a home version of the "drill" thing they use in some frozen yogurt places. Until then the best bet is to let the ice cream or frozen yogurt thaw in the fridge for a few hours, then stir it up with a spoon until it's the preferred level of softness
 The Black & Decker IC200 Arctic Twister Ice Cream Mixer is a product that you must not purchase. It is a total waste of money. It's designed to make soft-serve ice cream at home. The are not enpough pro's and way too many cons. the only Pro: It makes soft-serve ice cream when ever you want.CONS1. It's LOUD and Noisy2. The ice cream you use in it must be as frozen as it is the second it comes out of the freezer which makes it very hard to scoop out.3. If not used correctly, it make a huge mess.4. It wastes ice cream. When you use this product, half of the ice cream gets stuck inside the machine.5. by the time its finished, ice cream is pratically melted.6. You ongly get about 1/3 of what you put in the machine. The rest gets stuck inside the machine.7. You have to hold onto the on switch while operating the machine.8. You have to hand pump the ice cream into soft-serve yourself. This Black & Decker IC200 Arctic Twister Ice Cream Mixer is such a waste of money. I So reccomend not buying this. Just going to Dairy Queen or Baskin Robins is a much easier and cleaner solutio
 I had a Black and Decker processor that I got as a wedding present over twenty years ago, and it never let me down once. When it was time to get a new one, I got this 1500 thinking that it's a B&D and I can't go wrong. Well as as soon as I tried to grate some cheese the plastic ring on the shredder/grater blade snapped off. The next time I used it a metal pin in the pastic cover that holds the blade securely broke the plastic groove it was in. Too bad B&D went down the drain through the years
      I received my food processor for Christmas.  I had noticed the same processor at a different store that came with a bonus blade for fine shredding.  I decided to see if I could buy accessories for mine online.  I could not find any accessories or replacement parts for the Power Pro II.  I was concerned about the number of unfavorable reviews I came across during my search.  Despite the numerous negative comments concerning the motor going out, I decided to keep it.  I used it for the first time tonight to make a sauce and was only halfway finished when it stopped working!  I strongly recommend NOT purchasing this food processor
 I read the reviews after I purchased it. We made grated cheese (turned out so so) and *tried* to make hummus but it wouldn't even turn the blade and was very, very noisy. I'm returning it to Target tomorrow. If it can't stand up to crushing a few cooked beans then it's no good to me.I read the reviews after I purchased it.

 I purchased this Black &amp; Decker Food Processor on 12/30/04 at Target. I used it the first time to grate cheese and loved it. However, I used it tonight for only the 2nd time to chop some onion and celery and it started smelling hot. Smoke started pouring out the back. I will be returning to Target tomorrow and NOT purchasing another Black &amp; Decker kitchen appliance
 I LOVE THE COLORS AND THE HEAT RESISTANCE BUT FOUND THE WOODEN HANDLE ON ONE SPATULA ROUGH AND SPLINTERY.  ALSO THE SPATULA IS SHOWING NICKS ON THE EDGES OF THE SILICON....DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I DON'T USE IT ON ROUGH EDGED BOWLS OR PANS

 These dishes, first of all, are just beautiful.  The white looks so wonderful on the table and the presentation is just fabulous.  That said, be prepared to buy and buy and buy these if you like the looks of them. They break horribly easily and the cleanup, well, we just won't go there.  I've had mine for 10 years and now I'm down to just two of the serving pieces.  They break very easily in the oven, in the cabinet, you name it, it's gone.  If you're looking for a better one, go for the Le Creuset La Poterie line, or just grab a Longaberger one.  They're definitely worth it because you'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece.  I hate trying to clean these after using them so I just don't use them anymore for anything but to mix items.  That way, nothing gets baked on them and I am not breaking nails scouring off the mess.  I definitely recommend getting something else
 We registered for this as a wedding gift and were disappointed to find the large dish shattered in both the first AND second box we picked up. It's a very attractive set; too bad it can't actually contain food due to broken corners, can't be washed in a dishwasher, can't be used on the stove, and can't be used to broil! You can't use the ramikin dishes for creme brulee, which is why I wanted them. Additionally, Target doesn't allow you to open the box in the store to check the merchandise. I realize most of the other reviews complain about the shattering too, but I just thought I'd point out that the Corningware doesn't have to be shipped to you to arrive broken
 The blender part that holds the blade broke the second time I used it to crush ice. The food processor part works ok, but the major problem is it's extremely loud. It's beyond the pain level. It's so loud, I have to use hearing protection or my ears are ringing for 15 minutes afterwards. It's louder than my circular saw
 I picked this up recently and tried several varieties of loose tea in it.  The bottom line is that tea does get stuck in the one that I own.  I have tried a couple of methods to get the tea out to no avail.  It might be hard to see from the picture, but the "holes" for the water are actually slits in the bottom around the bottom rim of the infuser.  The slits are actually sickle shaped and the tea gets caught in the narrow areas.  I imaging that differences in the cuts would either make or break this product.  In my case they make me want to break it
 I had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely. The rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter, even with daily cleaning. Sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night, very noisily, until I put a timer on it to turn off at night. It was very diffult to clean, even with daily inspection.I had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely.

 Great idea, horrible execution.  Disgusting to clean, rake gets clogged.  There are much better options.  Litter Robot is well worth the extra cost
 At first it looked like it was going to work great (when the litter was clean). After a day or so, it wasn't cleaning very well. I got better litter and it started working better, but still not great. Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake. After about two weeks of use, the rake stopped moving backwards. I tried to fix it, but it just won't go in reverse. Overall, this was a big waste of time and money. I'm not even going to try to get another one. A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean. It's too bad as it had a promising beginning. DO NOT BUY
 I loved this bread machine, but it broke after owning it for about three years.  My husband took it apart to try to fix it, but could not repair it.  It was making bread and just turned off.  We could not get it to turn back on and the manual was not helpful in trying to fix such a problem.  We now have to replace it.  It worked great until it just stopped working.  I think a breadmaker should last longer then three years.  Also, I did need to make sure the ingredients in the corners of the pan got mixed into the dough, so I couldn't just program it and leave the house
 I FOLLOWED BREAKIN INSTRUCTIONS AS WRITTEN ON PG 3.THE CLEAR SEE-THRU TOP WARPED.UNIT WORKS,BUT IS UGLY. I CONTACTED SALTON AND WAS TOLD MY UNIT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY,TOO OLD!

 The information on the pages that pertain to this hose needs to be changed to reflect the fact that the hose DOES NOT fit Hoovers with a HEPA system.  It only fits Hoovers with product #'s beginning U53.., U54.., U64..  I ordered it along with a new Windtunnel that has a Hepa system, since the product information stated that these 2 items were bought together by other people.  Unfortunately, it does not state that these people (now including me) have to return the hose because it does not fit all Windtunnels.  So be sure to check and doublecheck before you buy.  ..
 Upon opening the box I found that the information given in the buying information for this product did not reflect the actural product. For one thing it only fits unright WindTunnel models that use bags.  This hose is for models beginning with U53, U54 and U64 only
 I bought this set and was very pleased until the grater just snapped at the handle. This implies that there is a support problem with the manufacturers design
 I use this rice cooker mostly for brown rice and it is a fiasco.  You need to put in 1/2 the water that you are supposed to, wait until that is cooked in and then add the other half.  Adding all the water up front causes the cooker to boil over - a real mess with rice.  It looks OK, but it just isn't the quality item you would expect with the name Cuisinart.  The price is also reasonable, so its not the end of the world - it might be better for things that don't require as much water or cook time (like white rice)
 Bought one recently from a Mervyns sale.  Rice burned especially at the bottom (black & crunchy).  So I returned and got another one in case the 1st one was defective.  Nope, did the same thing.  So next go around, I added more water, but still the rice tasted funny- a burned taste- although the rice didn't burn as much this time.  For the cost and design, I was hoping this would be a great rice cooker.  Design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord, however, this cooker can't even perfom its main purpose- just plainly cook rice without burning it.  Yes, I did add enough water and followed instructions and used the measuring cup.  Hopefully they'll improve it.  Better yet, maybe Krups can design a better abd sleek-looking yet working rice cooker
 I bought this in October, 2004 because I wanted something small for my kitchen.  You cannot cook over 2 cups of rice without it spurting out all over the cooker.  Now, it shuts off mid-way and I have to wait for it to cool down and try to reset it.  Hopefully the "powers that be" will read these comments and make improvements
 I ended up returning this because every time I tried it with brown rice it burned the rice. I even tried doubling the recommended water amt. for brown rice and it still burned. 
 Air Purifiers were recently reveiwed by Consumer Reports Magazine. They are quite ineffective and can be dangerous to your health. For further info, read article in Consumer Reports
 I had a hard time with this product. The item does not cut the dough well and the ravioli kept opening as a result of this. In my opinion, I like the size of a 12 count ravioli maker better. This 10 count makes ravioli thats too large
 I have many fond childhood memories of making and decorating sprtiz cookies with my mother. She had an old copper and stainless steel cookie press and it turned out perfect cookies almost everytime. When I found the Kitchenaid cookie press on clearance for a mere $4.97 at my local Sears, I snatched it up with high hopes of recreating those fond childhood memories in the kitchen.

As stated in another review, many discs don't seem to work at all well with this press. I tried the tree, candy cane, and star discs and every single one just squirted out an uneven messy blob.

 I have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best.  Only problem is that they RUST!!!  I had mine a few weeks when I noticed the rust spots on the interior.  I don't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot, so it must have happened simply because I leave water in my tea kettle at all times.  The directions that come with this kettle say not to do so, but any serious tea drinker like me knows that's unrealistic.I have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best.

 i have to echo what was said, cheap not up to what you would expec
 These sheets are not quality. They are no way equal to the value that the seller has assigned to them. The jersey material is very thin and the construction technique is inferior. They are NOT a bargain
 The colour is pretty but the sheets shrink quite a lot after washing (in cold water).  I bought a queen set for a full bed and they still don't fit properly after careful washing . I would recommend buying a KING set for a full bed. This was my first experience with cotton jersey sheets so I didn't know what to expect but I wouldn't buy them again
 This is NOT Caphlon!!! You can buy this at Bed Bath and Beyond for  $10 !!
 In theory, this is a good machine.  It did, in fact, work as advertised for a brief time - then it started to smell.  All of the urine, drinks, vomit, whatever nasty stuff you just vaccumed up from your carpet, starts to pool under the holding tank.  As it festers there, the exhaust fan takes that wonderful aroma and blows it all over your house.  This, to an extent, is simply a nuisance - bad smell and extra clean-up of the machine itself - until it starts leaking all of that crap back into your carpet, making more mess than you started with.  The first time this happened, Bissell customer service sent a replacement unit.  We started having the same problems with it shortly after we received it.  Bissell only wants to send us another (no doubt defective) unit - so unless you want to be stuck with a stinky, urine-leaking, mess-maker, don't buy this product !
 We purchased the Cuisinart SmartPower blender for smoothies and light duty blending duties.  It's a nicely designed unit , very stable on the countertop, but very poor quality gear drive.  After a couple dozen uses, the motor gear wheel broke, apparently a common problem on these Cuisinarts, as noted by other reviewers.  Cuisinart customer service is worthless - it costs more to ship and repair the unit than to replace it.Replaced the worthless Cuisinart with a Kitchenaid.  Would recommend avoiding Cuisinart blenders due to this gear design flaw
 AirBake products are horrible! I have used the cookie sheets multiple times and I have had nothing but problems. There products over-brown everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans. I have better luck using my old cheap non-stick bakeware than AirBake. Buyer beware! If you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature
 Awkward handles and lightweight feel.  Bought as a gift and had to be returned. Chicago Cutlery has better lines.
 I used this press about 4-5 times during the 5 years I owned it.  The cookie shapes came out well, but after a few uses, the plastic ring around the barrel cracked.  This year that same plastic part broke entirely, making the press unusable-- a critical engineering materials defect.  Like the other reviewer (Dec 2005), I too am now in the market for an all metal press
 I have had these dishes for only 1 year and they have ALL chipped and cracked and the glaze is cracked as well.  I have re-ordered a set of bowls and several plates and had the same results.  They say they are "microwave safe" but after the first few uses, the dish heats up to the point of burning your hand (or worse yet the unsuspecting hand of your child or guest!) and the food/liquid inside stays cold.  I am SO disappointed and am now shopping for a new set of dishes
 The unique design of this dinnerware line is lost in the low quality earthenware body.  This low fired clay body breaks easily, is bulky to handle and is just plain disappointing.  Before you buy, beware.  What is the dinnerware made of?  If the dinnerware is not high fire stoneware, porcelain or a china clay body, forget it.  If you plan to use it then you are wasting your money.  Someone should be ashamed
 This item is metal and looks like an old fashioned ice crusher, but it is so small that it is useless. Its only 9 inches tall, so if you are expecting a nice big heavy duty machine, forget it. I bought it because I missed the ice in the door of my old fridge, but after trying it several times, I sent it back. It is so small that you rap your knuckles on the counter. I dont think there is a glass made that is small enough to fit in it, so you have to use the little tin cup that comes with it. I takes about three loads of ice to fill the cup, and about 2 cups to fill a glass. You need 4 hands to operate it: 1 to hold the lid, 1to turn the crank,1to keep it from bouncing all over the place, and 1 to hold the little tin cup in place  (it slides out and then the ice lands on the base). Then when you finally get a cup fulll of ice, you have to try to get it out of the tin cup and into your glass. I broke the glass the first time i tried it. It hass little rubber feet that fall out and disapear, making it even more wobbly. But as I said in the begging, it IS cute
 the furniture itself is fine. or rather, it would be if it was shipped properly. before ordering anything from target, think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return. if you receive something damaged (and you will), be prepared for an extensive return process. chances are, the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well. this happened to me twice. if you're lucky, you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments. this, however, will take time. additionally, even if the piece is not cracked, you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood. i bought the desk, the hutch and the bookcase - all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain. the furniture itself is fine. or rather, it would be if it was shipped properly. before ordering anything from target, think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return. if you receive something damaged (and you will), be prepared for an extensive return process. chances are, the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well. this happened to me twice. if you're lucky, you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments. this, however, will take time. additionally, even if the piece is not cracked, you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood. i bought the desk, the hutch and the bookcase - all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain. also be advised that target does not make it clear that certain pieces will not be delivered at all if you do not make arrangements with the outside carrier. after waiting and waiting, and calling target on several occasions, someone will eventually relay the information that you need to call the carrier and make a delivery appointment - even though other pieces arrived without such complications. also be advised that target does not make it clear that certain pieces will not be delivered at all if you do not make arrangements with the outside carrier. after waiting and waiting, and calling target on several occasions, someone will eventually relay the information that you need to call the carrier and make a delivery appointment - even though other pieces arrived without such complications. quite honestly, this has been far more inconvenient than it was worth. by the time you pay for the shipping and the tax, this is not so much a "deal" but a waste of time and money.

If you plan on making blended soups, beware of the explosive force with which this beast turns on. Without a heavy hand on the lid, both the lid and your soup will hit the ceiling. Moderately thick, viscous liquids (a lemon cream was the latest such one I experienced) tend to get caught in the scalloped swoops in the jar. This leads to only the center portion of the liquid being actively blended, while the outer edges stagnate and remain clumpy. Deft work with a spatula is required to coax everything into the blending area.The problems I found led me to toss the blender.

Deft work with a spatula is required to coax everything into the blending area.The above problems were annoying, caused occasional swearing, but  were tolerable. What finally got me shopping for a replacement was worse. After several years of moderate use, the KitchenAid stopped working. The blades and motor are connected via a set of rubber teeth. These reduce operating noise, but over time, weaken. The problem first arose when making smoothies with chunky frozen fruit such as strawberries. A burning rubber smell came from the blender coupled with a strange noise and no action in the container. The rubber drive teeth slipped, and friction quickly heated them up. The result was hot, floppy rubber teeth that bent flat instead of turning the blades. When this happens, it takes 20 minutes or more before the teeth are capable of another round of use. Before long the blender could not even swirl water for more than a few seconds before the teeth slipped
 I thought it was me but every time that I lift the cover on this oven, there is this strange rotting smell.  It doesn't seem to matter what has been in there, either.

 I just baked a loaf of banana bread in my loaf baker and the entire bottom stuck to the pan when I turned it over.I am throwing it out and will never buy another piece of it
 Received the bowls yesterday, and once again very upset to find 3 of the 4 broken.  This has got to be costing a ton of money in refunds and shipping.  I will not try again for a replacement, I didn't do well with the Sango mixing bowls either.  Can't understand why these are shipped with such little packing material
 I purchased the Robinson Pyrex Candy Thermometer as a replacement for my old, cheap tube thermometer that was giving off readings.My experience was that the probe failed to register temperatures above 100 degrees celcius.  It would get there and just freeze.  My experience was that the probe failed to register temperatures above 100 degrees celcius.  It would get there and just freeze.

Or a more reliable brand of candy thermometer.  It's much better to shell out the extra dollars and get beautiful consistent results
 The only positive thing I can say about this candy thermometer is that the design allows it to stay on the sauce pan relatively well.  Other than that, it is difficult to discern temperatures between the 0 - 50 marks.  Also, it tends to read low so that the candy is much warmer than the read out indicates.  Since using this thermometer, I have ruined more batches of fudge than I care to think about.  If you want a good candy thermometer, don't buy this one. 
 The pan itself is fine, but it measures closer to 16" in diameter.  The cooking surface is 12", but the pan has such a wide lip around it that it doesn't come close to fitting in my convection toaster oven
 I bought a set of these years ago, and used them almost daily...freezer to oven to table, on the range..never a problem, and wanted to replace the same sized casserole. As the previous reviewer stated,the rough and unfinished  bottom of the dish was coarse and gritty, and scratched my table and counter. What a disappointment! I don't believe the older set I have was made in China, but here in the USA. Save your money
 The cooking set looks great.  However, once you heat the pot/ pan, the steel material handles become super hot.  I have to return the huge box
 Don't be fooled by this apparently well-designed grater. The hinge is weak and will break. The grater looks and feels great, but don't expect it to last

 Absolute rubbish.Cheap, inferior product, don't waste your money.It doesn't hold in place while you mill anything. This product is guarenteed to make you lose your temper

 I have used this pan 3 times, twice to cook meat. It does not brown; the meat stick to the pan. I made stuffed artichokes last night and even though I used olive oil and water to begin the steaming process, the pan was a mess to clean. I have never had any problems with Myers anodized pans, 18/10 pans or,of couse, teflon. I'm not sure what this pan will be useful for but I believe I will only use it for vegetables or rice

 I have always used Rubbermaid or Tupperware plastic storage, but I replaced all of them with Pyrex glass storage containers in May of 2005. I was worried that the plastic storage was seeping toxins into my food when I washed it in the dishwasher. Also, I liked the idea that glass does not stain and it gives a clear presentation of stored food in the refrigerator--making leftovers more likely to be eaten before they go bad.I have always used Rubbermaid or Tupperware plastic storage, but I replaced all of them with Pyrex glass storage containers in May of 2005.

 I'm actually having trouble sleeping on these sheets they are so uncomfortable and rough. They may be technically 320 TC, but they do not feel like more than 150! Strongly recommend against buying them. Mine are going to have a nice life as paint drop cloths.
 The rating I give this item relates to the lack of value.  In a few more clicks, you can buy a service-for-eight of white corelle for less than what three of these dinner plates will cost you. That said, I have owned my Corelle (two services-for-four) for more than twenty-five years, using it regularly.  All dishes are intact, they are light and stack nicely, and maybe I'm just not enough of a snob but I don't know why anyone would need any other dishes

I just recommend that you buy it somewhere else.
 I purchased this product in a retail store. The packaging clearly states it is dishwasher safe. Then after you unpack it, and read that if you put it in the dishwasher you void the ten year warranty! Do not make the same mistake I did, avoid this product
 I have used Pyrex bakeware for over 20 years, and I was shocked when my fairly new 9x13 pan shattered.  I figured I just got unlucky and got a bad one.  I was going to buy a new one - thank goodness I read the reviews first!  And yes, I did follow instructions - I baked my lasagne at 350 degrees, did not use an open flame or broiler, etc etc.  I can't believe this safety hazard is still allowed to be sold!  I am so mad!  I am switching to Corningware now
 Well Im the newest victim of exploding pyrex.  Last night I was cooking some salmon in my 3-quart pyrex that I've had for 3 years and used many times before.  It was in my oven at 400 for only 25 minutes.  I pulled it out and set it on the counter.  Well I leaned in to check the salmon and as I pulled away the glass exploded! Not just broke but a full on explosion of glass flying everywhere.  Thankfully I pulled away when I did because if I had pulled away 2 seconds later I would have had a face full of Pyrex shrapnel. I came away with only a few small cuts on my stomach...and from what I've heard I was lucky.  Even though my boyfriend and I swept and vacumed our kitchen last night there was so much glass that in the morning light I could still see little pieces of glass all over the kitchen.  Im not taking any chances, Im throwing out my other Pyrex dishes and switching to all aluminum trays.  Please DO NOT USE PYREX! It is not worth the risk! You may have a few years of good use, but is it worth risking your safety or that of your children?Edit- I would just like to comment that I was using the dish within the guidelines. The oven was 400 and the dish was only in there for 25 minutes.  The kitchen was rather warm and the surface I set it on was not hot but definately not cool...so there was no drastic temperature change.  There were no scratches or cuts any where on the tray so I do not feel that the explosion was in anyway my fault. This explosion was purely the result of a poorly manufactured item
 I have been a chef now for seven years and have not ever had a problem with pyrex.  Until now.  Last night while roasting some potatoes in a 400F oven, my pyrex dish exploded.  It rained glass all over the inside of my oven.  It was a disaster.  I am just thankful that nothing happened to me or my two year old who was in the room at that time.  This sounds like a REAL PROBLEM! 
 I was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after I figured out how to make it work, loved it. After a while the latch on the top broke off and I had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee. That made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down. It was a little inconvenient but I got use to it. Then the metal filter broke and I decided to get a new one. Luckily I put the old one in the garage for "spare parts" because not long after I started using the new one the side tab broke off and I had to grab a replacement off the old one. I will probably not purchase this brand again
 if you want to buy this color buy anchor bakeware it is so good
 I owned a Rival crockpot for 20 years and was very happy with it.  When it stopped working I therefore bought another (this one) from Rival.  I've used it twice.  The top doesn't seem to keep the liquid in, even on low, and it burned the food both times.  I don't trust it now and am not sure whether I'll try it again.
 I bought this because it was well priced, good sized and looked better than many other slow cookers. I assumed it would work as well as my 10 year old slow cooker that I gave away. The first time I used it (as soon as it got up to tempurature) the lid started to rumble and slip around the top. Then came the spitting hot water and steam that went in my toaster down the side of the cooker and on the counter. The lid is the worst! At first I thought maybe I was missing a rubber seal or something on my lid. Now I realize this is the way it was designed! I made a pork roast in it which usually works great but in this slow cooker it seemed to cook quicker with no liquid left because it evaporated through the faulty lid. The only way to correct the spitting water and the rumbly,tumbly,bouncy lid is to put a paper towel under part of the lid but even this eventually fails because the towel gets soaked and then starts to drip on the counter. Not to mention its probably a fire hazard. I don't think my paper towel idea is what Rival had in mind when they designed this! I wish I could return this but I threw away the receipt.    
 The lid does not fit and is not heavy enough to keep it firmly on the pot.It allows liquids to escape.I think this could be a problem
 I have had this for 2years now and what a waste of money it has been. I have used this a few of times before I decided to toss them.  This set was a disaster.  The parer is dull period and the peeler peels off much more than just the skin, you lose almost 20%(no exaggeration) of the fruit or the vegetable
 We have had this machine for about a year and it might have work right the first time we used it.  We now have to borrow a friends Hoover Steamvac when we need to clean the carpet.  We are getting ready to buy a different machine bcause this one would never work right.  It never has any suction power and it constantly sprays soap everywhere even if you have it only on the water selection.  I wouldn't buy
 I really thought I would like this product when I got it out of the box.  It's looks well made and looked easy to use.  I followed instructions and cleaned it throughly and put my recipe misture and miniture sausages in it to slowly heat and to use as an appetizer.  I put the the heat setting on warm as I was not in a hurry and I left the room for about 5 minutes.  When I came back there was mixture all over my cabinets, counters, etc. and what was left was boiling and sputtering like mad.  I later found out that no matter what heat setting I used it would over heat.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone I'm sorry to say
 I've had to bring this back to Hoover 5 times in less than a year.The belt for the self-propelled motor comes off ever other time I use the vacuum. The on/off button has been fixed 3 times.  It works when it wants to.  Even the guy at the Hoover store admitted that this piece of garbage is known for problems with the belt coming off.  I have nothing good to say about this.  I'm  a huge Consumer Reports fan but they missed the boat on this one. They need to update their testing over the long-term. I'm still pissed I blew $250 on this ridiculous excuse for a vacuum
 Like many others, I bought this because it came highly recommended by Consumer Reports.  It worked great for a while, but after about a year the brush stopped spinning.  I replaced the belt (twice!) but it still won't work.  If I didn't read about so many others having similar problems, I would have guessed that I just got a bad vacuum - but after reading other reviews here at Amazon, I see that this is not a model that anyone should buy, despite the high rating from Consumer Reports
 The tea press works fine if you are planning on serving a crowd.  For one or two people, it simply doesn't work.  You must add an enormous amount of tea for the press to work properly.  I once had a smaller tea press, and I thought that was what I was purchasing here.
 I have other Oxo items that I like very much, but these Stainless Steel Measuring Cups are a big disappointment.  I also experienced the handle bending easily when packing in brown sugar.  They will be in my next yard sale
 I really like OXO products.  I have a number of their utensils in my kitchen and I enjoy that they have nice big handles.  Since I started getting gadgets for my kitchen I always wanted these measuring cups.  Well I finally got them.  I was very excited to use them for the first time.  Well I went to scoop some brown sugar and the handle started bending.  I was very disappointed in how flimsy the handles are.  I think I'll stick to my plastic ones from OXO, I had better luck with them
 Usually OXO produces well designed items that have you thinking &quot;They *really* thought about how this thing was going to be used (and abused)!&quot;  Unfortunately the other reviewers are spot on -- very bendy handles.  It's a shame, but you should pass on these
 I have been making ice cream in a Cuisinart machine for years but I wanted to regain my freezer space from the 2 canisters I had to keep ready.. I also wanted to make good gelato since I can't go to Italy all the time. I had first bought the Lussino 4080 by Musso. It was terrible. Too soft right out of the machine and full of ice crystals when put in the freezer for any amount of time. It didn't get firm, it became a rock. I returned it and got the Lello Gelato Pro instead.  It is quieter, has a washable bowl, costs about half the money, weighs much less and makes 2 quarts rather than 1&1/2 quarts. There is no contest. The Lello is the superior machine

 The old OXO tea kettles had a train whistle sound.   This new one has a single high pitch whistle that is so weak you couldn't hear it in the next room.  Save your money and buy something cheaper.  It will work as well if not better.  I returned mine and got another brand and it works just fine and it was cheaper too.The old OXO tea kettles had a train whistle sound.

 Unlike the other reviewers, my Kitchenaid cork screw worked fine for almost two years. It never quite pulled the cork far enough out of the bottle to suit me -- it didn't make cork pulling labor-free -- but I found it much easier than any previous such tool I ever owned. Alas, as in many of the other reviews, the screw finally broke off in a cork and the device seems irreparable. A cheap plastic cork screw had to be called into service. I just visited the Kitchenaid web page and they don't offer a cork screw for sale anymore. I presume that I will soon toss mine as well. Planning to buy one of these for $30? Clint would ask you: Do you feel lucky
 Like 7 of the 8 other reviews, this product broke with no way to repair it.  For the price and apparent sturdiness, it is just one big failure and is to be avoided.
 HOOVER HAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE BELTS STRETCHING OUT ON ALL THE SELF PROPELLED VACUUMS, BUT WILL DO NOTHING FOR CUSTOMERS STUCK WITH THEM! WE MUST REPLACE THE DRIVE AND PROPEL BELTS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS. REDICULOUS POOR CUSTOMER SERVIC
 This torch just does not work.  I won't stay lit for more than a couple of seconds.  When it does stay lit, the flame is horrible.  Please, for the love of God, do not waste your money on this
 I, too, bought this terrible piece of equipment. My complaint, aside from the odd taste, consistency and smell, was that you could not tell when the egg was done. It was still raw at 10 minutes. By the time it was cooked you could have used it for a nerf ball. What a waste of money. As far as thinking up other purposes for it, I suppose it could be a sacrificial camping outdoor firepit cook pan for something.  You'll have to think of something, just don't put eggs in it
 its just a simple plastic tube that fits on the end of the grinder attachment so you can stuff sausage. So how did they manage to mess this one up? The flare at the wide end of the horn does not sit flat against the head of the grinder, so when you go to tighten the ring down to hold it into place, the collar can not screw on all the way. The result? A build up of meat in the front part of the collar. This eventually begins to drip down making a bloody mess of whatever is under the grinder attachment. How hard would it have been for Kitchenaid to design the horn so it fitted flat in place and the collar would have screwed on tight? 
 Disappointed with the size of product, have not used it yet
 I have ordered and returned twice and my third one they sent has the same result.After a few uses it seems to twist off stroke and stays that way.
 I purchased this handsome can opener in June 2004.  Feels & looks substantial and promising.  It worked ok for a couple of months, and now it's useless.  I'll return to using my zyliss opener, and throw this in the trash
 To be fair, the design is great looking, size is ideal, and very functional.  However, beware of quality and packaging.  Whoever packaged this in Thailand did not take care, it has nicks and scratches everywhere..not to mention the dings in corners.  Paint in all the panels is inconsistent..therefore, you can see different colorations throughout different panels.  It is somewhat redish in stain tone, could be darker to be a true dark walnut.  Manufacturing flaws such as missing drill holes, which makes it tough when assembling...got screws, just missing screw holes.  I only recommend to those with a nack of wood handyman, not for the average person.  Recommend you need the following tools: Drill with phillips screw heads and drill bits(just in case), small bottle of dark wood stain(to touch up painting the scratches), and some patience.To continue, beware when placing this table on a true flat surface, it may have uneven stance...ok on carpeting.  And beware if displaying in bright lit areas...people may see the different paint tones, and difference between the two table.  Lasting, it is not 100% solid wood, some panels have veneer over particle board.  Heck, what do you expect for $69bucks..
 I was so excited to receive my DeLonghi Caffe Sorrento Bar4 4-Cup Espresso/Cappuccino Machine.Being an experienced expresso drinker I started to brew my expresso, needless to say the frother works so so good you do not even have to turn it on.  Water and steam everywhere, also the frother does not turn off, I tried so hard that the knob came off.  I was very dissapointed

 My husband sweats a lot at night and I thought this would stop the problem.  It didn't at all.  It doesn't seems like it does anything for me either.  It just feels like a normal mattress pad.  Not exactly worth the price for a normal mattress pad
 Regardless of the setting you use, you will get half coffee powder and half coarse grounds.  In addition, the feature that is intended to allow you to control the amount of grounds you make with a switch on the top ... does not work.  Be prepared to grind more than you need, and then measure the grounds (somehow avoiding the powder) yourself. 
 In my case I can't even say it's noisy because the grinder didn't work at all! Manufacturing defect deprived me the chance to listen how it works
 I bought this thinking I would be able to regulate the size, (I have had my other coffee grinder for 10 yr. still works), to say it is loud is an understatement, & 1st thing in the AM.  I had it about 2 weeks, when I noticed it was hot to the touch, and it no longer worked, mind you I had not used it in 2 days, and had moved it to clean.  I have not contacted them at this point, but do not want a replacement, and a part of me is glad it broke, so I don't have to listen to the noise anymore
 I ordered the My Cafe from Amazon in early October and received it a few days later. On initial set-up, the unit failed to prime. I talked to Bunn's Service Dept. and was coached to try several steps, which did not work. I was given a return authorization number and told that I would be sent a brand new machine once they received the defective one. I have Fed Ex verification that the My Cafe was received by Bunn on October 18. I called Bunn on November 6 and was told that they would check on my replacement and call me back in a couple on minutes. No return call came. I called again on November 9th and was told that the My Cafe has been on back order and that I am in line with an unknown other number of customers awaiting shipment. They could not, or would not, give me any meaningful information on when I might expect to see if the replacement works any better than the original. My Cafe may be a great machine but Bunn's service is atrocious
 I got the machine yesterday and was so excited. I got it all ready to prime by following the directions, and it didn't work. After several attempts I called Bunn customer service thinking that I must be doing something wrong. When I talked to the customer service rep. he told me that the machine wasn't pumping hot water into the reservoir and that this was a common problem with the machine. I'm thinking for $200.00 this isn't right, and why hasn't the company fixed it? He was very nonchalant about it as if it didn't matter; just get a new one. This just isn't acceptable to me. There are many positive reviews so I'm sure if you get a working one than you'll probably be happy with it. As for me, I refuse to use something that has a known problem that the company isn't even trying to remedy. Therefore, I'm sending it back to Amazon for a full refund and buying the Simple Human coffee maker which has gotten great reviews
 The frother is great!  Easy to use etc.  The espresso temperature is 140 degrees F when measuring the stream of coffee coming from the machine after the machine has warmed up for 6 minutes.  At that LOW temperature you can't extract the flavors and aroma required for a great cup of espresso.  Other reviews stating it can take 5 minutes to brew a cup of espresso are accurate.  This occurs when the grind is too fine.  I've had this machine for over a year and it is NOT recommended. I use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine.  To add insult to injury, the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap.  I thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble.  Previously I had a Gaggia which is superior in every manner, and cheaper also.  The only reason I rated it 2 stars is because of the frother. 
 I bought the Capresso 114 last December (the difference being, the model 112 has chrome trim and a very questionable milk reservoir). This machine is unbelievably finicky; you must use an extremely coarse grind (according to the manual), and almost zero tamping pressure (again, according to the manual), otherwise you get unbelievably slow coffee flow (several minutes for a shot of espresso). Even when you get everything according to instructions (which includes, according to Capresso tech support, disassembling the machine every few days), it takes at least 5 minutes to pour a shot of espresso, which comes out weak, bitter, and with no crema. After two months of discussing this with Capresso tech support and getting nowhere, I returned the machine to Amazon. After that I bought a Krups XP 4000 -- bliss! The machine makes great espresso in about 25 seconds, even with a fine grind and firm tamp.
 This machine is sure to disappoint a seasoned European-style coffee drinker (coffee as in beverage made from coffee bean, not a tall cup of Sanka as the term is used in the US). Admittedly, I'm really picky about my coffee, but $250 for this machine is ridiculous. I've had coffee from a $40 Krups machine that is better than that made by the EspressoPro. I use high-quality pods with this machine (Molinari, Lucaffe, and Miscela d'Oro) which guarantees consistency in other machines, but doesn't help with this machine. Here are my issues with the machine.

I HAVE to put water in my espresso cup and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds before making an espresso or else my coffee will be lukewarm. Disgusting, even with high quality beans. Granted, unless your machine has a cup warmer, this is probably a good idea regardless of your machine, but with this machine, it is a REQUIREMENT, not an option, if you want hot coffee. 1.

Second, steamed milk is lukewarm on a good day. The same heating problem occurs with steaming milk. I called Capresso, and they said to check all the fittings. In fact, after much frustration (I'm not an idiot), I finally just sealed the connections with shrink tube, which leaves only two points where the connection could be weak. Still, I can't get HOT steam. What I do get is either lukewarm liquid milk, or cool, overly thick foam. In fact the foam is so unrefined and thick that it gives the impression that you could chew it.

As explained above, the heat is not sufficient, and the quality of foam is irregular and bad. I'm embarrassed to serve coffee from this machine to guests, let alone drink it myself. I just can't get over the heat issue. Nothing kills a good coffee than lack of heat. This point is so important, if you take a gander at the Francis! Francis! X1 (and professional machines), there's a thermometer right on the front of the machine (and no, it's not purely an esthetic design issue since you can put several types of gauges/switches on an espresso machine--like a pressure gauge). The low heat generated results in really thick, solid foam. When I have guests, I just heat milk on the stovetop and use a handfrother instead of using the EspressoPro's lame mechanism.

Second, the way you adjust the foamed milk to steamed milk ratio is not effective. A little gate is regulated by the user through a twisting tab. It's just not good design. Since the milk actually passes through the machine and is heated internally by the machine, you can't really "work" the milk. A wand offers direct control and offers immediate visual response to whether you're getting foam or hot milk. Second, the way you adjust the foamed milk to steamed milk ratio is not effective.

Well, that's now inside your EspressoPro. With a traditional wand, you just wipe the wand with a wet rag. With this machine, you need to run hot water through the frothing mechanism (BEFORE you do this you need to wait for the block to heat up again).

Granted, I use pods, but still, a certain amount of crema is expected. This machine produces a thin, insufficient amount of crema. The lack of sufficient pressure probably has to do with the poor thermoblock. 3. 18 Bar? Yeah, right. This machine also doesn't generate enough pressure to develop nice crema.

Better yet, spend $50 more and get an entry level Gaggia or Saeco. With this machine you're paying for looks and a gimmicky, ineffective frothing mechanism. This hunk o' junk is now buried deep in the back of my kitchen cabinet, as I truly would not feel right pawning this machine off on someone else. It is now appropriately "retired" from service, and I now enjoy perfect coffee every day from my Saeco Vienna Superautomatica. Now that's a machine, baby
 Inside this unit there are 2 cleaning trays, one for the cleaning solution and the other for water to rinse. Each tray has a cup coming out the bottom which is used to lock the tray into the device. After only 3 uses the base of the one cup cracked. After about 6 more uses the other bottom cracked. I would not recommend this product to anyone. 
 This worked great...for 5 minutes. I tried everything to make it work again over three days. I finally contacted customer service and they said there is nothing else to do - send it to them and they will replace it. I'm glad they were responsive, but now I have to pay to ship the darn thing to Michingan
 I too have experienced the water tank caving in and not working properly if you forget to take the water tank out of the steamer unit, and mind you, you must also remove the cap from the water reservoir even after you remove it from the steamer.  I have tried putting hot water in the tank in an attempt to regain its original shape to no avail.  I would not recommend buying this steamer for this reason
 As another reviewer experienced, our Krups also leaks coffee all over the counter and subsequently the floor quite often, which is apparently related to having to have the carafe situated in just exactly the right place within a half a millimeter, and which place I have not yet discovered except occasionally by chance.  Carafe positioning appears to be the problem, because it doesn't leak every time.  Maybe my unit is defective, because other reviewers don't mention this, and believe me, you would notice this if it were occurring with yours.

I wish I could find a reasonably-priced, non-leaking 12-cup machine with removable water reservoir, no-drip carafe, programmable, auto shut-off, easy-to-find replacement carafe and removable filter basket but alas, even on amazon.com, that machine does not appear to exist.  My sister has such a machine (Mr. Coffee URX23), but that model has been discontinued. 
 I had slightly older edition of the Krups Crystal Aroma for several years, until I lost one carafe too many - if you're careless, when empty they tend to roll like a bowling ball right off the countertop.  But that's my fault.  The Crystal Aroma carafe looks cool and the filter would probably help if you have unpleasant tap water, but overall, the quality of the coffee it produces is merely OK.  The reason not to buy this coffeemaker is that Krups now makes a much better one.  "Aroma control" is a poor description for the recent line of Krups coffeemakers by that name actually do.  The Aroma Control machines have a simple, but ingenious mechanism for retaining the coffee in the brewing chamber for an extra minute before letting it drip through into the carafe.  More than filters or an exotic shape that supposedly retains aromas, that extra minute of brewing makes all the difference in the world.  Unless you're just in love with that round carafe, skip the "Crystal Aroma" and move on to the "Aroma Control" line. The reason not to buy this coffeemaker is that Krups now makes a much better one.

 I ordered the Pro 5 Plus three times and recieved the wrong one 3 times.  They kept sending the "Commercial 5 mixer."  In the meantime I have accumulated 2 shoping bags full of baking goods.  I have ordered many  "cookie" art books, along with many supplies as well as the Set of 3 Pasta Maker attachment for this mixer.  This has been going on since the beginning of December.

 I ordered these glasses 3 times and everytime they came in a million pieces. I would not waste your time purchasing these
 My first Cuisinart 4-slice toaster developed a dangerous problem after the 3-month warantee period: it started heating when not turned on, and made strange clicking sounds.  It never had toasted very well, and only toasted lightly on the darkest setting.  To their great credit, Cuisinart replaced the toaster for the shipping cost alone (although it took 3 months). The replacement toaster also toasts very lightly, very slowly, but at least it's not an immediate fire hazard
 I saw many good reviews for this toaster and a few bad ones too. I took my chances and ordered one anyway.I saw many good reviews for this toaster and a few bad ones too. I took my chances and ordered one anyway.Cuisinart is not testing these toasters. It took 10 seconds for me to see that the inner elements are not heating up. They are cleaning them, possibly changing the elements, and shipping them.  My guess is that it is just cheaper not to test them. Big mistake. It's harder to win back customers than to keep them.
 This sifter broke a month after I got it. It seems sturdy but it actually requires carefull handling. The sifting is somewhat slow but good (excercise!!!)
 The Amco sifter broke during the second time I was using it and the first time I used it it took a long time and the handle kept sticking. Also my hand, wrist and arm were hurting so bad from all the work it took just to get four cups sifted.  It also leaks flour where the handle is at the bottom
 this item is too big and very difficult to operate.  it is the worst breville product purchased.  the panni press does the same thing without the difficult cleaning.  i would NOT recommend this item...too much money...definately NOT worth the cost
 Brass rivets expand and contract. Wood expands and contracts. Together these elements are a bad concept from the word "go", because they will ultimately separate because someone will at one time or another put them in the dishwasher. The metal is only tempered 4 times leaving the metal soft, meaning there is a lot of sharpeing to do. Henckel, cutco, trident are expensive and chefs all over the world use them because the are used everyday and they retain their sharpness because they are tempered 7 times (the maximum amount before metal becomes so hard that it becomes brittle) Brass rivets expand and contract.

 I purchased this blanket because I loved the color.  That is the only thing it has going for it.  There were feathers all over the place and I keep finding random ones in rooms on different floors!  It is now stored in an airtight bag because I can't toss it- I paid good money for it
 Be aware, if you are looking for bonechina stay away from this piece. It is made in China and very low qualit
 I had bought this vacuum because of the good reviews.  I wanted a cordless vac to take care of the quick jobs -- not heavy cleaning -- but the primary job was to do to take care of daily kitty litter cleanup (rescued mother cat and 4 kittens).  It does a good job for lint and hair but doesn't work on kitty litter.  It spits it around or keeps in roller section.  I thought I was using it wrong and tried it every way -- but it only picks up a small percentage of the kitty litter and rest is just blown around or drops out when it's turned off.  I'm going to have to buy another cordless vaccum
 I received the 14.4 volt vacuum for Christmas 2004.  After a full charge, it lasts less than a minute.  It would be great if the battery lasted, but it doesn't.  Go with another product and save your money on this piece of junk
 I bought this product about a year ago and for a while it worked great. Then I noticed that the unit was starting to shut off faster and faster until today when I finally decieded to toss her. Overall in the beginning yes there is alot of power but what is the good of it when the battery's life is only about a year before she goes. I wouldnt recommend one especially since Dirt Devil came out with a cyclone one which I will try with hopefully longer lasting results.

 First of All I was abt to buy this product... but cancled my purchase as I found the same kind toaster with less price in the market..But same time I bought one kitchen utensils set.. and I am sorry to say it is just usable not good one like I they shown.. I saw many utensils set with same number of item atleast 500% times better than what I got,Second thing, I wanted to cancle the order immidiately but I tried to find out the customer care no on the amazon site.. but I could not find one :o((any way thats why I have decided not to buy from this site anymore...as now I can't rely on the pics only..
 Easily the worst toaster ever.  Brendaa the 5 star above must have gotten the single toaster in the whole production series that actually worked.  There are just not enough words in the English Language to describe this utterly useless peice of junk that will not hold toast down etc. etc..  Well, maybe not useless, if you are looking for something to bring about a cathartic welling of emotions that has you standing in the yard with a maul and and a toaster at your feet.  I'd give it a minus 5 stars, but they do not even have a 0 star vote
 This grinder grinds well but failed after just 2 months of operation.  Don't buy it unless you want to waste your money
 This pricey toaster is not worth its weight in bread.  For the first few weeks it seemed to evenly brown the bread but since then it has become the worst toaster I have ever owned.  It is impossible to get evenly browned bread instead you get burnt crust and blotches of brown randomly scattered over the bread.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
 Stop Be For You Buy!!!!  Should have saved my money.  Making pasta with this machine is disappointing.  The recipe given with the instructions is way to sticky to run through the extruder.  I redid the dough 3 times before I was able to extrude it, and still it stuck together.  I should have listened to the rest of the reviews, but having owned a pasta maker/extruder before I thought it would be a piece of cake.  If I were you I would invest in the roller pasta maker for you mixer.  On the bright side though...The food grinder is wonderful
 I have not tried this pasta attachment a second time - I'm afraid of harming the motor.  The mixer became VERY hot and oil even leaked out.  I going to get the mixer checked/serviced and not risk damage again. One thing missing from these reviews is the mixer models used. Perhaps those with the heavier motors work better?  I have the smaller motor (250 W) K45SS mixer.  Surely KitcheAid must read these reviews. I would expect some additional user information for this product on their website, but see nothing. Very disappointing product and consumer support.  Come on KitchenAid - give more info and/or offer to give $$ credit for return of this questionable product
 The only 2 foods it grates well are parmesan and chocolate, as long as the chocolate is cold, not worth the money, I think I'd rather use my small hand held gater.  It was a good try, but I won't buy another one
 I've purchased several different rotary graters and this one had the same result as many of it's other plastic siblings.  It too broke within 2 days of use.  These plastic graters just aren't built with much strength and should not be used with harder cheeses, or by someone who has a strong grip.  The common defect I'm finding in plastic graters is how the rotating arm is attached to the drum.  The tiny amount of plastic there isn't desined to withstand shearing forces which is what rotates the drum.I've purchased several different rotary graters and this one had the same result as many of it's other plastic siblings.

 The first Dolce item I purchased was the wine tower and I have been very happy with that piece.  However, the coffee table and end tables all arrived with cracks.  The coffee table was not glued together properly and was misaligned.  Not pleased at all and way too costly to ship back
 I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mother.  I was very excited when it arrived much sooner than I had anticipated.  I opened it up, so that I could give it to my mom assembled.  Unfortunately, an entire corner was broken off and the other corner was cracking and splintering.  The packing materials are insufficient to say the least.  I immediately called target's customer service, and the operator very graciously assisted me in returning my table.  Despite my dissapointment about the broken table I was glad that Target did the best they could to resolve my issue without any hassle.  &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;
 It looked like a great Idea, just what I needed to get my older golden in and out of my jeep.  Problem is, there is a serious crush hazard because of the weight and design.  There is a finger &quot;crush area&quot; near the hinges where a user would most likely grasp the ramp to fold it. I have mashed fingers several times and sustained a moderately serious crushed finger the last time I used it.  If I can't make it safe with a saw, then out it goes.  It's too dangerous for anyone in my family to use
 I splurged on this pan because I was tired of the &quot;wobble&quot; my cheaper pans developed on my smooth glass cooktop. This pan warped severely after only 4 months, not any better than pans a fraction of the cost. I plan on returning it for replacement, and will use the new one for low temperature sauces only
 I had a littermaid a couple of years ago that lasted me for a year and did great. I am not sure what is wrong with this type we had it for a whole week then it stopped working. Do yourself a favor and do NOT get this
 When I bought my first LitterMaid box, I thought it was a miracle -- no more scooping! Hooray! It worked so well for my four cats that a few months later, I bought a second one. Unfortunately, the second box quit working after just a couple of weeks (and I'd thrown the receipt away, so I couldn't get my money back). Soon after that, the original box quit working, too. So, within about 6 months, I spent close to $200 on electric boxes that no longer functioned.When I bought my first LitterMaid box, I thought it was a miracle -- no more scooping! Hooray!

I now have three of them -- no electric parts to break, and, actually, less mess than the LitterMaid
 The Littermaid Mega is absolutely one of the worst purchases I have ever made.  In less than two months time, the unsubstantial motor has burned out completely.  Litter Maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat.  Well, I have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily.  The Litter Maid is good for controlling odors when it works, but it constantly jammed and then shut down (and I used a recommended brand of premium cat litter).  After a few weeks of this load, the tiny (and very loud) motor simply gave up.  I'm waiting to hear from Litter Maid regarding warranty repair/replacement, but I suspect I'll end up returning to a traditional $5.00 litter tray.  The overall concept of the Litter Maid is good, but without sturdier components, it ends up being trash in no time
  I VERY MUCH ENJOYED THIS UNIT WHEN IT WAS NEW IT DID EVERYTHING THAT WAS STATED ON THE BOX.However, I now need to replace the IFD filter due to the accumulation of nicotene on it and can not find one anywhere. I purchased two units at once for around $450.00.If I had used them in a "dust" atmosphere they would still be great! Honeywell should have tested on Nicotene and smoke odors before touting the phrase permanent in reference to smoke and nicotene. I am sadly disappointed in a company, who over the years, I have purchased many of their products
 The machine is easy to use and makes great espresso ... when it's working!Mine broke down within the first year.  I spent $80 dollars to fix it the first time, but it broke down again after another two months of use (water wouldn't heat up).  It would cost me another $200 to fix it.  I'm now looking for a more reliable machine.

 I bought both this and the similar version from Brookstone this year.  I was expecting a lot from the metrokane, but it turns out the Brookstone is much better.

 I bought one of these to make Bagna Cauda, and upon loading the necessary ingredients and depressing the "high" button, it sparked and died. Well, ok, I guess it only *half* died, as the "pulse" button would still work, if I leaned on it with my entire weight, but both the "high" and "low" switch settings did nothing. So I'm thinking next time I'll spend a little more; meanwhile, this little guy goes back
 I only used mine once, then tossed it. Wish I would have read these reviews first!  Thought it looked good at Kohls.  I liked that the grates can be seperated to wash... they do, but it takes a lot of force.  Feels like you're going to break them. I should have returned it but I was mad at it and trashed it.. at least it was marked 15% off (still higher than here though).I only used mine once, then tossed it.

 Really nice bowl with cover.  It mushed up the tomatoes and the safety handle you hold on to broke on the second use.  It does however make very thin slices
 Great while it worked, though a little large. But, it broke after 4.5 month
 too slow to give reading almost never changes
 I have purchased these plates from Amazon in the past and the earlier plates were made in England.  So, I ordered more to go along with my current set to find that now they are made in India and were not of the same quality as those made in England. I sent them back. I will say that had I not already had the more detailed & colorful items, I might have appreciated these of lesser quality more than I did. 
 I was dissapointed that this item arrived broken and I needed to send it back for a refund
 cThis is my second bread maker. I bought Cuisinart's one last year and had used it for about a year. I had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point.cThis is my second bread maker. I bought Cuisinart's one last year and had used it for about a year. I had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point.Cuisinart's one has obviously some problems: 1. Bread tends to be darker so quickly and becomes hard. 2. It is very noisy during kneading cycle as I can not hear the music from the audio. 3. Paddle is caught in the bread and hard to remove it if you do not remove it before baking cycle starts. 4. Some basic cycle have no "Pre-heat" cycle. It means I need to prepare exactly appropriate temperature water to make yeast work nicely. But it is very hard and sometimes I fail. 5. The design of the case is not great. Some unmixed ingredients are left on the corners and baked as it is if I do not mix it using a spatula. 5. The design of the case is not great. Some unmixed ingredients are left on the corners and baked as it is if I do not mix it using a spatula.One of my friends owns Panasonic bread maker and showed it to me. I was so surprised at it as the thickness of the case is very different. She has never had such a problem which I have had. Then I decided to get Panasonic one although my first one is still working. The bread maker was delivered in 2 days. I tried same recipe which I often used for Cuisinart's. The bread came out amazingly nice and much nicer than the one from Cuisinart. Bread is nicely blown, crispy outside and soft, fluffy inside. It is just perfect. I guess these difference come from mainly these things: 1. The case is very thick so that bread can not be brown so quickly and keep the inside of bread soft and flavorful. 2. "Pre heat" cycle adjust the temperature of water well. I do not have to make appropriate temperature's water any more. 3. This machine has the special room for yeast. It works very well to keep yeast away from the water particularly using the timer. 3.

 I was so looking forward to this machine. I am a long time machine bread maker and have had two other brands with not a problem. First, Yes it burns the crust on MED; Second, I made 4, count them, four batches of their recipe bread and my recipe bread and they were ALL awful. Could not believe it.

Instead, it pivots and swings up.  The problem with this is that you cannot fill the bucket all the way up with ice because you have to leave a good amount of room at the top for the lid to swing.  And, because the lid is not removable, it gets in the way especially if you want to use this bucket as a champagne/wine cooler.  Poor design flaw.  I want an ice bucket that I can remove the lid and put it aside if I don't need to use it rather than having it sticking up and in the way. You'll notice in OXO's main picture of this bucket on this site it is shown without the lid sticking up.  Why?  Because it makes for a cleaner look not having the lid in the way.  Hey OXO, that's the same look I wanted this bucket to have sitting on my bar! This is a gorgeous ice bucket. It is large and stylish.  However, I cannot recommend it because of the lid.

Or they could have looked at every other ice bucket on the market to see that theirs is the only one in which the lid doesn't come off.

First of all, it's an ice bucket!  I think everyone knows ice is inside without needing to peek through the lid.  Secondly, a metal lid will keep the temperature inside colder longer than than a plastic lid. That is why the bucket is made of metal, not plastic.  Metal is a better conductor of heat and cold.  I wish I had noticed the lid before I purchased it.  I didn't pay close enough attention. I suppose I assumed it was a normal lid that came off like all the others.  Thankfully I got the bucket from my local Bed Bath & Beyond making its return very easy.  I am sorry I have to return it  because this really is a nice looking bucket. However, I don't intend to spend $40 on an ice bucket just to sit there, look pretty and receive compliments--that's my job as hostess :-).  I want an ice bucket that is functional too.

 I picked one of these up for my husband for Father's Day. It looked like a great idea, avoiding the mess of ice and rock salt. We followed the directions exactly and were very disappointed when chocolate soup emerged from the maker. We put it in a container in the freezer and ended up with a chocolate brick! Needless to say, we are not at all happy with this product
 I have a Profesional 6 model, and I did everything the recipe said for 1 batch of regular spaghetti pasta.  It didn't kill the mixer, but the motor became very hot!  I will never use it again.  I also have the roto slicer/shredder, fruit/veggie strainer, food grinder & sausage stuffer attachments...none of these have even made my stand mixer very warm.  --That tells me the pasta maker attachment is a bad product.  I am thankful that my model is 525 watts...I could only imagine what would have happened if I had a classic 300 watt model!I have a Profesional 6 model, and I did everything the recipe said for 1 batch of regular spaghetti pasta.

They run between $20-40 without a motor or $80-120 with a motor (that you can also buy separately for $50-80). --A very small price to pay, if you want to keep your KitchenAid Stand Mixer!
 Have been wanting to get the pasta roller attachment and ran accross this plastic pasta maker at the store.  Was really excited since it was in my price range.  Took it home and tried to use it.  My KitchenAid mixer starting smoking and so I let it rest for the hour.  Upon removing the attachment I found oil and black rubber or grease was all over the inside of the attachment. (on the coil thing that pushes the dough through) Next time I wanted to use my mixer to beat egg whites it had no power.  I sure hope this inexpensive attachment didn't ruin my wonderful mixer.  Highly disappointed with KitchenAid on this attachment
 If you buy this this thing, be prepared to cut off about an inch off the tip, 'cause apparently the tip is just there for aesthetics. Plunging this thermometer into boiling water, it won't read accurately (15-20deg under) until at least an inch of the tip is immersed
 Very annoying that you can't get the filters for this coffee maker anywhere
 The bag is narrow and difficult to fill.  You invariably end up with a mess which gets even more messy because the bag is made from a very slippery plastic.  I had no luck using this bag, even though I gave it two chances
 I purchased a 14-cup Cuisinart some years ago.  I have had nothing but trouble.  First the handle stuck while I was kneading dough and I barely was able to pry it off.  Then I had problems with the stem.  When I tried to get a new one from customer service they told me that they were no longer servicing my older model and suggested I buy a new Cuisinart!  Stay away from Cuisinart!  I'm looking into Kitchen Aid for my new processor
 I recently purchased this product.  The first time I used it, I thought it worked great.  I made a pot of chili and let it cook until we were ready to eat it that night.  The second time I used it, things were not as good.  The outer shell where the controls are were literally melting.  I had programmed this to cook for 10 hours while I went to work.  I came home that night and the hours had not changed. I realized I didn't click the on/off button to start heating the cooker.  This may have saved a house fire.  I went ahead and changed the time from 10 to 4 hours.  This set the unit to high instead of the original low setting.  Not 15 minutes after turning on, the outer covering was melting.  I immediately shut it off.  I see the 4 quart units were recalled back in 2004 for similar issues.  Whatever their problem, it has not been fixed.  Be aware of this serious problem when using your slow cooker.  I am returning mine and will exchange for a different brand
 Bought this for the kitchen and the only piece that truly does what it is supposed to do is the vase they give to hold all the pieces.  The spoons both melted in pots of boiling water stirring spaghetti.  The spatula bent and distorted while trying to lift something off a hot cookie sheet.Bought this for the kitchen and the only piece that truly does what it is supposed to do is the vase they give to hold all the pieces.

 Stainless my foot! I received these from my wedding registry and only just used them for Thanksgiving this weekend. After one run through the dishwasher, several pieces are rusted, the finish has worn off, and they are even pock-marked in places! I too threw away the box when I first took them out, and cannot find *any* information on warranty or how to contact Cambridge Silversmiths.    I've bought cheap individual pieces of stainless for *camping* that stood up better than this. I wish I'd put Oneida on my registry instead of this crap
 These sheets are like 200 cotton count not 1200 cotton count. Do not order you will be sorry!!
 These silicone pot holders are indeed brightly colored, easy to wash in the dishwasher, and protective even when wet.  They are also clumsily stiff at the same time as they are slippery, the net result being a miserable failure in the kitchen.  They are useful for protecting a counter from a hot pot, but not for picking the hot pot up
 I just received my set. The glasses are so... beautiful! Yet, 5 out of 6 are defective!! What a big disappointment! I have been looking forward to receiving my first Riedel....Amazon.com provides great deal which I got $80 for 6 glasses, but they were obviously factory seconds! So disappointed! However, the design of the glass are beautiful!! I am still returning them! So sad!......  :
 Great sugar dish, fantastic colour, but Amazon's shipping time of 1-2 weeks is way off. I ordered this twice and had it take well over a month to arrive
 Amazon seems to experience a disproportionate number of "pricing errors".  Whenever you attempt to purchase anything at Amazon that represents a 50% or higher discount, don't expect to receive it.  Poor business practices
 This is our second George F grill.  The first one burned out after about 5 years.  We liked but could not get the same size so we got this one.  It was bigger than we wanted but we had no other choices.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!  After less than one year and not heavy use the connector to the thermostat (spade conn.) just fell apart.  Being the handy man that I am, I fixed it.  Today (9/6/2005) it burned out again.  This grill is a fire hazard and should be recalled.  It is a piece of junk.  We will replace it with a different brand.  Thanks for nothing George
 I wouldn't purchase anything from vision decour! I ordered this 3 piece set the same say I ordered pieces from three other companies. It took vision decour longer to just e-mail me than it did the other companies to ship and deliver the other three pieces I ordered. Apparently the set I ordered was out of stock, but vision decour neglected to update their web site. After they contacted me about this issue I checked their site and they still had the set listed as availabel and in stock. So now I have been waiting for weeks and have half of a living room with no prospect of getting the table set I needed to match everything else
 These bowls are wonderful - a great addition to my Winterberry collection, however they came packaged in the same packaging as they would in store, so during shipment they were broken.  Amazon was great to send replacements, but some of those were broken too.  I have finally received all dishes I ordered, but beware of receiving broken dishes
 My first and only use was to cook a roast in the oven at 275 degrees and within the first 30 minutes it started to give me the wrong readings.  I have had it a while but have not used it as it is only good for the oven. The statement on the inside instructions "WHEN COOKING IN A BARBECUE OR SMOKER, DO NOT USE AS A CONTINUOUS READ THERMOMETER, USE ONLY AS AN INSTANT READ THERMOMETER.", "5. DO NOT USE THIS UNIT TO MEASURE COOKING TEMPERATURES OVER 392&#9702;F." as well as "WARRANTY EXCLUDES THERMOMETER PROBES." should be on the outside, letting people know this is only for the oven for continuous use and that the probes are junk.  If you have to keep checking the meat in a smoker over many hours, a cheap $6.00 meat thermometer will work just fine other than letting out the heat.  Why does the outside packaging say the reading range is 86&#9702; to 572&#9702; if you can only use to 392&#9702;.  I would say this is only a typo and they likely did a cut and paste on their lower temperature unit's instructions, but 275&#9702; in the oven killed mine so maybe not?  Cut to the chase, look for a better unit and let me know when you find it
 I've had 2 Polder Thermometers and both of them have had a VERY short life span.  Don't waste your money
 This unit looks like it would be fun for the kids, but in fact, it barely works. Even when the insert is pre-frozen in a zero degree freezer, the maching has problems getting the mix even into a "soft" state, and even when it gets close to that, the ice cream does not dispense in a manner that allows for the classic soft-serve look in the cone. An email to cuisinart regarding the problem went unanswered. We used it twice, and gave up. One hint that's not in the instructions: you have to keep the machine running while dispensing -- or trying to dispense -- the ice cream. Another hint that's not in the instructions: don't buy this item
 The machine leaked after we poured in the liquid ingredients.The mix in dispenser did not operate properly, all we put in were sprinkles. The ice cream did not harden enough until about 25 minutes;kids cannot wait that long.We could of driven to the local ice cream store and back by this time. Save your money,buy a old fashion ice cream maker instead at least your kids will get a workout and be occupied at the same time
 Your freezer needs to at least zero degrees F in order to have the bowl freeze to a point the ice cream comes out a consistency thicker than a very thin milk shake. I needed a seperate chest freezer in order to achieve these temps.Your freezer needs to at least zero degrees F in order to have the bowl freeze to a point the ice cream comes out a consistency thicker than a very thin milk shake.

(Thanks mostly to the Ben and Jerry's recipe book we ordered at the same time.)  We'll look into getting a better quality ice cream  maker in the near future. It won't be made by Cuisinart
 This cooker made great rice...for a grand total of 3 uses before it broke! It also has a very thin and easily dented aluminum bowl that is NOT non-stick. There are better cookers out there for comparable prices. Don't waste your money
 That's right.  I got taken twice.  I bought this cooker for under $20 a few years ago, and it died after the second use.  Considering it was so inexpensive, I just bought another one.  It died again after only one use.  I wish I would have read the reviews beforehand because it seems to be a common problem.  I guess Salton just recycle their returns so they can afford to pay George Foreman the $90 million they owe him for endorsements
 I received this a shower gift a few years ago.  Standard mixer, can't do anything too drastic with it, but I noticed the last time I took the beaters out of the dishwasher they had rusted.  These are not stainless beaters and they will rust.  I'm in the market for a new mixer
 this is clearly a case of "you get what you pay for". for easy jobs this mixer works fine, but give it a thick batch of brownie mix or cookie dough and the motor will just di
 I've had this toaster for four years now. It just started going down hill recently. -It started toasting too darkly on the settings I had consistently used for years. -The digital setting knob no longer works, it is stuck on 4. -It only shuts off when manually popped up. I have to agree with other reviews that said it doesn't toast very even. I've noticed this in my four years of use. So if your willing to pay the price for it to last 4 years get it. If not, try another with better reviews
 Don't bother buying the pots.  After only 2 months use, the inside edges are cracking off (I hand wash all the pots).  I have a fry pan of another brand that I have used for over 3 years and this never happened.  In addition, in spite of purchasing the 12 piece set and three additional pans, they refused to give me a $20.00 promised rebate.  I'm ready to junk the set
 While these are pretty & feel good in your hand, they rust. I had them for 3 days when several of the forks began forming rust inside the swirly patterns.While these are pretty & feel good in your hand, they rust.

 I was excited when I got the set, however after a few cuts/uses the knives are dull and the santoku has rust on the sharp end of the blade.  For a warranty claim I have to pre pay postage to get a replacement.  Not recommended at all!  I'm surprised at the low quality with this brand
 We own a set of 2-Man Pro series and this set did not even compare. Returned them the same day they arrived to my house
 I have a set of mid-range Henckels that I bought some years ago, and they are -much- better than this.  I bought this set for my daughter because they were a good compromise between quality and price, and she won't ruin then in the dishwasher.  I would have thought that Henckels wouldn't make any actual crap, but this set comes awfully close.  The good thing is, boy are they sharp.  But there's bad things too.  Only the 8" chef's knife and the shears have any feel of quality at all, the rest are -very- thin and flimsy.  'Laser-cut' edges are overrated - make them another millimeter thick please, so they can make a precise cut without the blade bending and taking off in an unintended direction. A good knife is an extension of the cook's intention - it does what you want, and does NOT require thought and pre-conception and compensation in every cut. (...)is waaay too much for one adequate chef's knife and some toys.  Very disappointed in Henckels, and in Amazon too, I don't feel I got what I ordered.I have a set of mid-range Henckels that I bought some years ago, and they are -much- better than this.

 we got this as a wedding gift and it worked ok for about 2 years, but there are 2 plastic parts that have broken in the last month making it unusable. would not recommend this machine or this brand to anyon
 I myself am not a coffee drinker but after watching the lengths that my husband has gone through to get keep his coffee hot, I will agree with other reviewers, this Delonghi is Dewrongi. My husband has to boil the water in a kettle to pre-heat the carafe before brewing. If he doesn't get a chance to drink it right away, he puts the carafe (filled with coffee) onto the stovetop on low.  Well a couple mornings ago, we were both rushing around to get the kids off to school and off to work. Without thinking, he put the carafe on the burner but must have accidentally cranked it to high heat. Next thing I know I'm screaming from the kitchen because the carafe is on fire with 2 foot flames quickly spreading. He dumped a pot of cold water on it and hallelujah, no damage was done. (We are so lucky as we are selling our home in a few months.So after reading the other reviews, I'm no longer pursuing a replacement carafe but instead will buy him a whole new machine...and it won't be a Delonghi
 I went to Amazon after having several problems with this coffee maker only to find lots of others with the same problems.  Yes, deLonghi makes a great product.  No, this is not one of them.  I have read the directions so often I have them memorized, and I can tell from the number of reviews that there is a serious quality control problem with this unit.  I bought mine from Costco, and sometimes the manufacturers do something different for Costco product runs.  I hope that is not the problem, but that is all I can think of that would be causing such a disparity of reviews.  So...who else bought this unit from Costco?  Because if that is the problem I'll bet Costco will be all over deLonghi to fix it.  Until then, this is definitely not the coffee maker you will look forward to first thing in the morning, every day
 These knives barely cut.... and the title is misleading.  This set has nothing to do with Faberware.  Also, I have had this set for only a few weeks and already rust has appearred on them.  Buy them if you intend it for one time use
 These are not Farberware, but Hoan -- which makes cut-rate kitchen implements like knives, measuring cups etc. I sent these as a gift, and was hugely embarrassed when I showed up for dinner and found out I'd sent this junk.This is deceptive advertising at its worst -- shame on you, Amazon! 
 My Mom bought me this set for my anniversary two years ago.  We use it regularly and run it through the dishwasher and it is just horrible looking.  It spots and marks pitifully.  I can't get most of the spots off no matter what I do.  I wrote the company to complain and they said they would replace it if I mailed it in, but with the weight of the set (because it really is a heavy-duty set of flatware) it would have cost me a fortune to ship it to them and then all I would have gotten in return was another set of flatware that would probably look the same way in a short period of time.  So, I am just putting my experience out there to help others make an informed decision
 Used this burner during a kitchen renovation.  Doesn't heat very evenly for use with a skillet, but product is sufficient for boiling water for pasta and vegetables.  Wish the base was heavier for stability
 Hi, I usually don't complain about the products that I buy because I consider myself a savvy consumer, but in this instance I was dubbed big time! A few years ago, we received a  Krups coffee maker as a wedding gift and we love it! However, this particular toaster rarely worked. In fact, I would say that 85% time it would either not toast or would "flip" the toast prematurely e.g. 5 second or less. I have no idea if this is a  fluck in quality control or not, but I highly recommend buying a  different toaster. I know, I thought, Krups makes a toaster? Wow, I'll buy it, after all how hard can it be for a German company to manufacture functional a toaster? Well, evidently, they have issues. 
 Although Consumer Reports rated this model as #2, I have found this a very disappointing purchase. The cheap aluminum parts inside bend all the time jamming the toaster. It toasts very uneavenly and inconsistently. I am very sorry I purchased this toaster. I was expecting much more from a toaster so highly rated but I've learned that Consumer Reports does not always get everything right. Listen to the other warnings and stay away from this toaster. As soon as I find another toaster, this one goes off to Goodwill.

 I have had this gadget for a little over a year as we got it as a wedding gift.  I had not used it as it did not seem worth the trouble to plan on getting it out ahead of time and charging it for 15 hours when I could use a manual grater right when I needed it.  Last week, I needed to shred some cheddar for a recipe.  I read the instructions front to back, allowed it to charge the full amount of time, and I was pretty excited when it came time to try it out.  Right from the start, I knew it was junk.  You are supposed to be able to lift the piece of plastic up and have it stay in the up position while you change the blade.  Not mine.  The plastic piece kept coming off, and dozens of tries to keep it upright resulted in dozens of failures.  I decided to look past that and judge purely on the shredding ability.  Once I started trying to grate, I had a really hard time getting the thing to shred.  I tried varying degrees of pressure.  As others commented, the cheese does get stuck EVERYWHERE.  Then, the cheese that does come out is in tiny little shreds.  I did not get the nice big shreds that I am used to with my manual grater.  My husband thought I was doing it wrong, so he tried it.  He had the same result.  I will not even sell this at a rummage sale or give it to goodwill, because people are better off without it.  Since it was a gift, I'm glad I'm not out any money.  It is going in the trash
 i wish i saw the feedback before i bought this...this thing sucks you have to charge it 15hours just to get 23minutes of nothing.. it has no power and it just pushes the cheese it doesnt even grade it...please dont waste your mone
 To whom it may concern.  Cheap assembly, binds up on internal hardwear, does not press fully, all in all, very poor product.  You would be better off hand squeezing with you hand than you would with this item...Run
 After a couple of years of casual use, my bowl also cracked in the freezer. Fortunately I had it wrapped in a plastic bag so the mess was kept to a minimum. Now I'm in the market for one with a higher quality bowl.
 I received this as a gift for Christmas. It worked like a charm for ice cream and lemon slush 3 times. BUT then, the base burst in my freezer, spewing foul scented goo all over. I contacted the manufacturer to ask how to get it replaced, and NEVER HEARD BACK. Apparently they don't care about backing up their product. Now I have to buy another one, and it won't be this brand
 I bought this item on sale at Shopko, where it will be returned today.  I froze the gel disk as instructed, bought all the ingredients listed in the recipe booklet for vanilla ice cream, cooled the ingredients after mixing as instructed.  After 45 minutes of mixing I ended up with ice cream soup. You could let this thing run forever and never end up with ice cream that is set up enough to eat.  I put it in a container in the freezer.  The next morning I had an ice cream brick.  Not to be deterred I microwaved it for 15 seconds until it was soft enough to actually remove with my metal ice cream scoop.  This stuff gets harder than cement!  After all this work the ice cream had a bad plastic-like aftertaste.  I had to throw it all out.

The next morning I had an ice cream brick.  Not to be deterred I microwaved it for 15 seconds until it was soft enough to actually remove with my metal ice cream scoop.  This stuff gets harder than cement!  After all this work the ice cream had a bad plastic-like aftertaste.  I had to throw it all out.  If this isn't enough to deter you keep in mind that the "heavy cream" called for in most of the recipes listed in the booklet costs a pretty hefty price.  I paid $2.50 for the heavy cream listed to make 1.5 quarts of ice cream.  That price doesn't even include the other ingredients listed.

 I used this maybe a dozen times before I stopped using it out of disgust. The surface is fragile and hard to clean. I reheated pizza and the residue stuck so tightly it could only be scraped off with extreme care. I did a bone-in slow roast and the weight alone pierced the surface so the juices bled into the matting layer. What's the point if you can't clean it or let anything harder than Jell-O come into contact with it. I used this maybe a dozen times before I stopped using it out of disgust.

What's the point if you can't clean it or let anything harder than Jell-O come into contact with it. Just to clarify--the mat was used to line an airbake cookie sheet for the pizza and to line a baking pan with the roast atop of a bed of carrots and celery. I like my pizza crisp yet moist so I reheat it in a skillet when I can. I bake thin or drier pizza on an insulated sheet to keep it from getting desiccated. When I make a roast--I don't need any gravy. I slow roast the Alton Brown way and the juice stays in the meat rather than ending up in the bottom of the pan. The meat literally makes its own au jus in your mouth. I put a bed of vegetables on the bottom to further reduce the heat transfer from the pan to the meat.  Not cooking for a crowd?  Try a 3 inch thick steak (stood on end) cooked this way. You won't want to share. I don't slow roast turkey but it only takes 2-1/2 hours to do a 14-16 pound bird if you temper it properly. My sister always gets comments on how moist and juicy it is.

 Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst. Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking.

 Why would anyone rate these glasses more than 1 star if Amazon is refusing to credit for those broken in shipment
 The handles, although very cushioned, are TOO fat for my hands (which admittedly are rather small). I never really got to give either piece a true test though, because the blades on the parer and the vegetable peeler were way too dull to work well. I can't really recommend either, although the parer was a little better than the peeler
 This bowl does not work with the ICE-45 ice machin
 I'm sure that this is a wonderful can opener if you can figure out how to use it.  I recieved mine as a gift, and neither the giver, myself, or my husband can figure out how to use the thing.  I was told that the instructions could be copied from the internet, but who can find them
 I bought this flatware in spite of the warnings about rust.  Well, sure enough, rust started to form on the knives just after the first run through the dishwasher.  The rust spots were small, but I returned the set anyways, as I am not willing to risk the severe rust problems reported by others.I bought this flatware in spite of the warnings about rust.

 This DeLonghi toaster oven was not made as well as the previous one we had.  The grey plastic on the sides made it look cheap.  The stainless steel was very thin too. You could bend it easily. We returned the oven
 I was pretty happy with this toaster oven until last night when it just stopped working while I was baking some potatoes. I have no idea why it would just quit working like that. I am not happy at all with this product
 This was a great toaster, until it starting turning itself on.  After popping up the toast a few minutes later the heating elements will come back on.  KitchenAid has a recall on their proline series with the same problem but there is no recall on this model, YET.This was a great toaster, until it starting turning itself on.

 It spins on the counter and the juice always slips out of the cup! DO NOT buy this piece of junk!!!!! don't waste your money on this.
 I bought this juicer last week from a local store. It is impossible to keep it steady when you use it. You are luckY if you get the half of the juice in the glass!  The juice is all over the place. The unit started to make a loud noise after 2 days. I will return it this weekend and get my money back. STAY AWAY!
 I needed a compact cleaner to tidy up after my delightful cat decided to soil my couch.

That is a great idea, but there is no gasket to make the joints true and tight . . .. so while it may have 2 times the power of other machines based on sheer power of the motor, it looses some of this power when you actually use it to try and suck water and cleaning solution back up.- The option to spray water and solution or just clean water is part of what appealed to me about this machine.  However to accomplish this, the cleaning head has 2 seperate spayers on the underside.  Neither are centered, the one on the left operates when you have the slider set to solution and the one to the right operates when you have slider set to rinse.  As they are not centered, they overspray quite a bit past the edge of the cleaning tool. Mine sprayed a wide swath of rinse water about 3 inches past the edge of the cleaning head.  To top it off, when you release the trigger, the cleaning head continues to drip water for a few moments, meaning that you have to go VERY slowly or risk dripping everywhere.- The option to spray water and solution or just clean water is part of what appealed to me about this machine.

 The first, and only time, I tried to use this compact carpet cleaner was a total disaster. While removing an old sofa to make way for new furniture, the delivery men stained the new carpet. I whipped out our new Atlantis, filled the rinse tank and popped in the soap cartridge. With manual in hand, I tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs... The unit did not dispense soapy water, the hand-held wand leaked, and finally I discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet, creating a soggy new stain. So here I am with two stains on my now very wet carpet, furniture being delivered and an Atlantis unit sitting in my bathtub until I can find a large sledge hammer. Don't waste your money with this thing. There has to be a better answer
 Wish I had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before I purchased this. I went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a Braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 - 15 years.  After it got the new plastic taste out of it, it made good coffee. Even without the Brita Filter.  Just like all the reviewers indicated, the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully.  Unfortunately, it has quit working after only 2 1/2 months.  The seller, Etronics, is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period.  That will be the last thing I buy through them.  Like uhh, since they sell Braun,one would think they would have some recourse through Braun and try to help their customers.  So, here I am between the proverbial rock and a hard place,  try to find a Braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced, or just bite the bullet an go buy another. (want to bet it won't be a Braun?) Additionally, what do we do for coffee in the mean time?  Such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet
 I've had two of these now, and they both had one serious flaw: the trumpeted "brew and pause" feature DOES NOT WORK.  Pull the carafe out during brewing and treat yourself to a steaming hot waterfall of coffee that would almost be comical if it weren't such a relentless pain in the neck to clean up.Also, it's hard not to spill some water on the heating plate, either during filling or brewing, creating a consequent sizzling sound that adds a lot of ambience -- if you live in a steak house.Considering how many other coffee makers are available out there, these flaws make this machine a mistake.Too bad, because some things are done quite nicely: the controls are good and easy to set, and the overall styling is sleek, euro-cool, and compact.  Unless you live in a community where calcified sewage runs through the taps, the water filters do about as much as a rain dance.Pass on this one
 I loved this coffeemaker, until it just suddenly stopped working and it isn't even 1 year old!!  Previous coffeemakers I owned have lasted years and years.   I expect more from a coffeemaker that cost over $[...]+.  Now I have to find the warranty card and go through all that hassle.  I am NOT a happy customer
 I returned this the day it arrived. I heated the obligatory 4 cups of water as per instructions. Left the room and came back in 20 minutes. The warning light was not lit. I moved the crock to the side to see if I had not properly plugged it in since the light was out. I brushed my hand against the exterior lip and received a first degree burn. Farberwear company customer service said "the light is a little dim" but you should be able to see it. Yes, you can see it if you look up from below the crockpot you will see a faint glow. The crock pot sits very loosely in its container leaving a large gap between the food container and the heater housing.Heat escapes through these gaps which accounts for the overheated exterior. I would advise those with kids, especially, to find another slow cooker
 I received my Taylor Professional [and] it appeared to be behaving normally except it shut itself off after 4 to 7 minutes even while its readings were changing. Now, it is supposed to save its battery life by shutting off if there is no change in its temperature reading for 10 minutes, but it should stay on if its readings are changing. The temperatures were no where near the extremes of the thermometer's range, so this wasn't a case of shutting down because of that. ... I e-mailed the manufacturer about the problem and was told I could return it to them for replacement. I did this and less than three weeks later received a new one from them. Surprise, surprise -- this one behaved the same way, shutting off after 4 or 5 minutes even while its readings were changing. I e-mailed Taylor again about this and suggested they check out their existing supply of this model, as I suspected they had many that were shutting down like this. ... Approximately two weeks later ... I received another package from them containing one of their model 9845 thermometers, a different model! I received no communications from Taylor about this, other than their original e-mail stating I could return my original thermometer to them for replacement. I don't know what I'll do now. I would like a properly functioning 9878 ...
 I own this pan and the Bavarian and Chrysanthemum models too.  I think Nordicware makes very innovative designs which makes their flaw even more disappointing.  After a few uses, everytime I bake with these pans the cake always stick.  I grease AND flour these pans before baking and the cake still sticks.  One reviewer said to LIBERALLY grease these pans, but I don't understand why there's so much work for greasing a "non-stick" pan.  I had less worries when using a regular tin pan with no "non-stick"
 I purchased this item to be able to grill during the winter months when it's too cold to be outside.  It looks very nice and clean up is super easy.  The problem seems to be in what you decide to grill on it.The first time I used it, I grilled chicken breasts and they turned out fine and by keeping water in the drip pan, I had no problem with smoke.This is great, I thought.   The next time I grilled hamburger patties and even though I followed the same procedure as before, it smoked up my whole house. (these were not high fat content burgers either)  I added more water to the pan thinking it may have not been enough and it continued to smoke even more.  It was not a pleasant experience.  Right now it is sitting on top of my fridge and it may stay there until I decide to give it one more try.  If it fairs better next time I will return and give it a better review..maybe
 I finally just threw them out. They were apparently cured with some chemical and the smell was terrible.
 There are only two mixers on the shaft.  As a result it is very difficult to mix the ice cream into a thick milk shake
 We had registered for All-Clad pans for our wedding last year, and decided to go with a Calphalon commercial nonstick set instead.  The person helping us highly recommended the Calphalon One infused anodized set instead, and said the demonstrations he had seen were fantastic.  We bought that set and have had it for nearly a year.  We hardly ever use it, however, because things stick so badly, even with oil.  While the set looks quite nice and cleans up easily enough with soaking and Bar Keeper's Friend, I'm very disappointed with how it cooks and would love to be able to return it
 At first we loved this pan.  We've used it quite a bit, but recently it has started to warp and it gets worse when it is heated. I can no longer sear a roast and then put it in the oven because the pan is so uneven.  I've contacted All Clad and am waiting to see what they say. Needless to say, I would have been much happier with a less expensive pan.  I am very happy with all the other All Clad pans that we have, but this one is a disappointment
 This item is the black sheep of the All Clad line. It is NOT a triply pan like other All Clad products and is made entirely of stainless steel(no aluminum). It is also made in Korea where other All Clad products are made in the USA. This item is the black sheep of the All Clad line.

 I liked the look of these pots. I bought several 2 and 3qt pots mainly for boiling water for pasta, potatoes etc. The stainless steel used is very poor quality.I liked the look of these pots. I bought several 2 and 3qt pots mainly for boiling water for pasta, potatoes etc. The stainless steel used is very poor quality.After just over a month all of them have rust spots on the bottoms and where the handles meet the pot. After the first use I noticed small discolored spots on the inside bottoms, not your typical discoloration from heat, and they would not polish out with bar keepers friend. These spots are now where I see rust forming after each use. These are definitly no where near the quality of my all-clad and calphalon stainless steel cookware, but then again neither is the price.After just over a month all of them have rust spots on the bottoms and where the handles meet the pot.

 I bought this coffee maker, because some people gave it high recommendation here. I think I wasted my money.It worked only for a couple of days. Finally, it just stopped working and I had to push the button at least three times in order to collect a small cup of coffee. That is ridiculous for an expensive coffee maker priced at $80 above. It makes me feel that this Japanese coffee maker is like Sony-made products, having a fancy looking but lousy quality.Save your money for some other coffe makers, and avoid this one
 I have to agree with the other negative reviews. This insert loosely fits the All-Clad 3-Quart Casserole Pan I bought with it (which I could understand if I were trying to use it with another brand). It being from the same line and company one would think that someone would have tested how well it worked. As with all All-Clad products it's built very well but who cares about that if it doesn't work properly. Someone else mentioned all the perforations are in the bottom of the insert, it would be better if there were holes in the sides as well. I think my artichokes would cook a little faster if tons of steam wasn't rolling out from in between the insert and pan. It works, just not very well.I have to agree with the other negative reviews.

 We're a small restaurant (16 seats), serving dinner 4 nights a week, and we use the blender for soups, Caesar dressing, etc., once or twice a week, but never use ice in it or anything like that. We've had two of this same model now, and had the same problem with both of them. The black collar, the part of the base where you set the container, is plastic, and on both blenders has broken. The first time it lasted almost a year, and we figured that wasn't too bad -- especially when you compare the cost to a true commercial/professional blender, which are $300+. Also, we really like the blender in terms of function, so we picked up another one. This time, the exact same thing happene, except that the collar cracked within 2 weeks!!

I saw a model on their website but no purchasing info was listed; I emailed to find out where to purchase, and the rep seemed almost inconvenienced by my inquiry

Use them to seal  small glass jars or stainless steel bowls, and there is no loss of vacuum due to cracked plastic.FoodSaver has done a good job with certain items in their product line.

 I was disappointed in this product.  The butter slid out of the bell and into the water.  I think it would be better if the inside of the bell wasn't glazed
 I bought this set and was very pleased until the grater just snapped at the handle. This implies that there is a support problem with the manufacturers design
 This percolater makes great coffee and I was very happy with it until it broke within two years. Actually the first thing that broke was the little plastic knob on the top. I called the company and they were very nice about it. They quickly sent me a replacement part. I thought, what a great company. Then when it would not work one morning just a little over two years after I bought it I called them again. They explained that it was no longer under warranty (I think I missed the warranty term by a month or two.) They offered that I could purchase a refurbished one from them for about half the price of the original (I paid about $70.00, a refurbished one was, I think, $35.00) but it came with no warranty and I'd have to pay shipping. I was very, very disappointed. Thankfully, I had my old drip coffee maker in the attic. I pulled that out and have been using it although it does not make as good a cup of coffee as this percolator did. This product should have lasted me years. I am looking for another good cordless percolator but would not consider another product by this company. I gave it the two star rating instead of one because it did truly make a good cup of coffee but the two year life is just not worth the cost
 First the plastic top broke off at 6 months.  Then it stopped working at 9.First the plastic top broke off at 6 months.  Then it stopped working at 9.I have one word: Junk
 Less than one month after puchasing this pasta machine all of the pasta dies have broken.  The ring nuts cannot hold the dies in place and they break.  Maybe it is because I was making semolina pasta, but that should not be the case.  This machine has caused me way too much stress at dinner time.    Knowing what I know now I would buy fresh pasta at the store
 After my Ronco machine broke, I bought this one.  It never worked well for hollow pasta, and the bearings went out after about 20 uses
 I bought this on 8/4/06.  When I first got the coffee maker, I ran plain water through the machine to get the plastic smell out.  Afterwards, the machine still smelled like plastic, now I've ran vinegar through the machine and still no help.  The horrible plastic smell is still there.  Baking soda is no use also.  The only thing I've not used is bleach.  If you don't mind the plastic smell then this is a good small machine that works well with most coffee cups.  Makes really hot cups of coffee and none of the leaking problems
 These are plastic-y, one cracked after 2nd washing, they look like the little fish bowls from the county fair, so big you have to use 2 hands to prevent sloshing it all over yourself   :
 This was the best toaster over I ever owned.  But one of the infrared bulbs blew after about 4 months.  Does anyone know where to buy a replacement
 I can not testify as to how well this unit makes toast. I basically bought this Toaster oven for it oven capabilities. * I like the fact that the oven cuts off after the timer expires.     Things burn quicker in a toaster oven.* I like the fact that the oven cuts off after the timer expires.     Things burn quicker in a toaster oven.* My major gripe: I often can not selected the correct oven temperature. For example, today I needed to warm up some bread sticks to go with Italian dish. The box told me to set the temperature to 375 degress. Guess what, there is no 375 degree temperature on this unit. There is a 355 and 390. Other frequently requested temperature settings missing on this unit are 350, 400, 450. 425 is the only relatively common temperature setting that is found on this Toaster Oven. As a "don't fire up the big oven heating up the house on a hot summer day" unit, this toaster oven comes up a little short
 The Sango Splash line of dinnerware is gorgeous, no doubt about it. It's got a lovely combination of colors and textures and it feels great in the hand. So what's the problem? It chips. I've had a set of eight place settings plus various serving pieces and other extras for about two years. At last count, there were five pieces with chips and one cracked cup. That doesn't say much for the set's longevity, especially since I don't use these every day.
 This machine does not make clear ice, just like your in-refrigerator does not make clear ice.This machine does not make clear ice, just like your in-refrigerator does not make clear ice.Also, please read consumer reviews about function
 What I most like about this product is the crumb catcher feature.  Unfortunately, I have a problem with the acrylic piece at the end of the cutting board popping out when I am using it.  I would also recommend that the wood used be a harder wood such as is used normally with cutting boards as when I slice it leaves grooves in the wood
 I agree with other writers.  This unit is very poorly designed and built.  Cutting my third loaf of bread, the knife point came out of the guide, and on return, snaped one of the guides off.  Not washable, end plate falls off while cutting all the time, unit slides over the counter when trying to cut (rubber feet would have cured this).  I would look elsewhere before buying this unit
 Very disappointed in this product. It falls apart everytime you try to slice a piece of bread. The wooden crumb box gouges very easily as well. Just a piece of flimsy plastic. :( I ended up buying a much less expensive bread keepr that came with a slicing guide, about half the price and it works great :
 The 17 piece set is a great value but quality of the stainless steel is poor. The mirror finish doesn't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water. The bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd. When 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds. I didn't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set. Finding everything that I needed and used was more important. The set does heat evenly and cook well it's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore. This product is great if looking for style and going to hand it up over an Islan
 I grew up with Corelle. My mom still has a complete set she got before I was born. It survived four kids--all boys--and three marriages. I thought it was indestructible.I grew up with Corelle. My mom still has a complete set she got before I was born. It survived four kids--all boys--and three marriages. I thought it was indestructible.I was wrong.I was wrong.When I lifted the box from Amazon, I could hear shards of glass scraping around inside. I only needed to open one flap to see that, indeed, the entire set was destroyed. However, I should point out that the problem doesn't lie with Amazon. The damage is PURELY the result of Corelle, which clearly didn't intend for this box to be shipped solo. My advice: pick up a box locally at Macy's or Dillard's or something
 I like the Calphalon Contemporary line a great deal, and so I was pleased to find the steamer insert that fit my pan.  But my first attempt to use it was a failure--the small steamer holes (and not very many of them) are easily covered by the food to be steamed, leaving the insert to function like a double boiler.  After working for close to an hour to steam summer squash (which should take 20 minutes at most), I gave up and dumped the squash into the steaming water and boiled it.  I'm sure that some foods will steam in this pan, but items that lay flat like sliced vegetables will be a problem
 This steamer was only useful to get the wrinkles out of clothes that had been really balled up... it gets them to a state where you can IRON them more easily, but basically saturates with the steam so the fabric is damp. Sure there is technique to learn, but I spent a good long time on several different items. It heats up quick and produces steam well etc, but it performed far below what I thought were reasonable expectations. It also has a low hanger so you constantly have to extend the hose to let the condensation run back down or else get gurgling and low output. I returned it, amazon was good about that, and the return shipping was less than what amazon charged me in the first place
 Sigh. Was so excited to receive this item and it arrived today via UPS in pieces. I should have heeded the previous reviewer's warning. Doh! Oh well. Live and learn. Live and learn. Refund, please
 How durable can a pan be that arrives in pieces inside the box? I can't imagine breaking my old cast iron frying pan...this one had a huge chunk out of the side. I sent it back and will look for a better quality item. Shame on Mario for endorsing this thing
 With 3 different speeds you think you would able to make a shake or smoothie in this machine with no problems right? Nope, I am always running into problems with ice getting stuck around the blade assembly, and I do mean stuck!  I have not had this blender for very long, and I really don't use it very often either so there is no reason I should be told my blades are probably dull - its not like I was making a brick smoothie! AHH..  Also why does the lid stain so easily - I have never made anything that contains purple in my blender ans now my lid is permantly that color!  The best thing I can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put, and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands.  I have since purchased a differnt brand and have no problems!  Looks the mixer is the only thing KitchenAid has perfected
 After going thru several $20 dollar blenders in the last 10 years I decided to splurg and go for the Kitchenaid. Well it didn't last even as long as the cheap ones. The motor is still good, and the blades are still good, but they used a little plastic coupler between the two and it lost all it's teeth one by one. We mainly like to make milkshakes and smoothies about 3 or 4 times a week.
 I bought my first one about 14 months ago - it lasted about 8 months.  Motor made a high pitched sound and blew coffee all over.  I dismantled the whole unit - it then worked for about 2 days.  I called Kitchenaid - (they are right about no hassle warranty)  They quickly sent me out a new one.  This new one lasted about 6 months - and now has the same symptoms.  I really wish this was the grinder for me - I LOVE the Capacity for bean storage and LOVE the way it looks - I have been forced to look at other grinders.Hope this helps.  By the way - I used grinders twice daily - in the morn and then in the evening - not like I was putting a whole lot of strain on them!Hope this help
 I was happy with the performance of the strainer...easy to clean, fit well over the edges of pans, etc. But only a month after I received it, the handle snapped right off. I was draining a can of vegetables, so it doesn't seem to me that was overdoing it. I'll definitely check the fastenings on the next strainer I buy
 I baked two batches of madelines side by side, one in this pan (set on a baking sheet), and another in a traditional pan with non-stick coating. I brushed both pans with canola oil before using. As per the package instructions, I allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them. The madelines in the traditional pan released easily, were golden and high, and had a pronounced design. The other batch were almost soggy (probably from cooling in the pan), flat, pale, and did not have the appearance of a madeline. To make matters worse, they did not release easily, and a few of them even broke as I attempted to remove them. I would not recommend this pan
 We were so looking forward to fresh lemondade. The moment the Salton arrived we opened the box, pulled out the lemons we had bought in anticipation and began juicing. On the 5'th lemon the gears stripped and the juicer no longer turned when applying even the slightest amount of pressure to the lemon. We were all very disappoined, my 5 kids and I : ( I had hoped for better after reading the great reviews written by some of the others.
 I also tried some cotton Wamsutta sheets from Bed Bath, and Beyond and they pilled the first time I washed them.  I was able to return them to the store, but it was a waste of time.  I wouldn't recommend these sheets or any Wamsutta sheets because I think they're poor quality
 These knives are already showing spots of rust despite washing by hand & drying. Very disappointed in quality of finish
 the blender looks very attractive but hardly works. quite a bit of time even crushing a tomato. hard to believ
 This products is horrible.  It burns the rice and the heat actually bend the insert so the lid would not fit anymore and after using it only a handful of times it stopped working.  It is really terrible would give it zero but there is no option
 Don't waste your money. I bought this because it was small and I wanted a rice cooker that would make 3 cups and take up less storage space than the bigger ones. Don't waste your money. I bought this because it was small and I wanted a rice cooker that would make 3 cups and take up less storage space than the bigger ones. It burns the rice every time no matter how much I adjust the water ratio. And brown rice - forget it, even more burned on the bottom. You have to watch it instead of being able to rely on it doing what it says it will do. It has yet to turn out 'perfect rice.'

 Bought it two months ago, used it only twice and suddenly it stopped working within a week. Called manufacturer, got return label, sent in for replacement, but three weeks passed and I still have not received anything. So I called them on Nov 17, 2006, and was told they don't have this model in stock. The worst part is that they also said they do not know when it will be ever in stock, maybe tomorrow or may in a year.Bought it two months ago, used it only twice and suddenly it stopped working within a week.

 I was really looking forward to receiving this, but four weeks after purchasing online, I received an email from Amazon saying they did not have a supplier for my purchase!  I am disappointed in Amazon.  How can you sell something you do not have
 There is one huge problem with these sheets -- they are not permanently pressed.  There is no way to get out the wrinkles, other than by ironing them.  Otherwise, they are fine.  But who in the world wants wrinkled sheets!  You should be able to take them right out of the dryer and fold them with little or no wrinkles -- like your average sheet.  These sheets are full of wrinkles and they look just terrible on the bed.  I cannot believe you are actually selling these things on-line
 Great price, poor product. They are beautiful upon arrival. I washed them according to manufacturer's instructions. You would not believe the copius amounts of lint that piled up in the lint catcher of my dryer (usually a sign of poor fabric quality). While folding them up, I discovered that most of the hems had unraveled and frayed. And I hadn't even used them yet! Unbelievable. I returned them for a full refund, including shipping (and I stupidly purchased 2 sets). Goes to show you get what you pay for. Never again
 Works if you have COLD soda and it's frozen. After 2 cans it's done. Yes you get two of the sleeves, but I'm not pleased. Better luck with a 99 cent foam coozi
 This light is made of cheap plastic, has a faulty switch, and broke down within an hour of use. No good, waste of money, will not order from American Science again. Very bad experience. No response from company when I complained, would like my money back, and then some
 The timer worked great at first, but in less than a month, the alarm for the timer has stopped working and the magnet has fallen off.  I am only keeping the timer because the clock and the stopwatch are still useful
 I was at first very excited with my new Zyliss salad spinner - it looks great, and it's much easier to spin than the older string-pull version (not to mention the old-school "pump" versions, which required a lot of effort). However, as another reviewer mentions, it simply does not get your greens very dry. I've been surprised and disappointed by the amount of water left on lettuce after spinning, and spinning, and spinning
 Pan was what was expected but the muffins do not come out looking like a mushroom.  I was looking for a pan where the muffin top came over the muffin so you could break it off.  It's hard to explain.
 The interior of this pan got discolored after the very first use. It got yellow stains from cooking tomatoes in a little bit of oil. A lot of scrubbing and a cycle in the dishwasher lightened the stains, but the pan never got its new look back
 Bought this grinder after my Capresso grinder developed a crack in the plastic housing.  After using for about two weeks, I have to agree with other reviews that mention "static problem". The grinds cling to grinder and coffee end up all over the counter when trying to pour into coffee machine.  The plastic cover also somewhat awkard to get on and off.

 For years I used my mother's cookie shooter to make my holiday spritz cookies.  When I bought my first house I wanted my own cookie shooter.  Boy, I wish I hadn't purchased this one.

The rod has an indentation all the way down, so when it's twisting, it constantly skips back up and never eventually pushes the dough down the tube.

 I cannot believe what a WASTE of money this thing was. HUGE disappointment. I was all excited when I got it, made some cookie press dough, put it in, and... nothing. The plunger pretty much spins in place. I could PUSH the dough out manually faster than this thing can. I couldn't even get ONE FREAKIN' cookie out of it, onto the cookie sheet.

 i got the white color version and was happy about it but this one is half the goods/worth
 We thought this was smaller than pictured and not comfortable.  We were not pleased with this
 I have had this pan for a year. I bought it because it was on sale and was shopping around for a new pot set. I figured it would be a good test run on the Circulon brand. It grills great,but you will spend  twice the cooking time cleaning the pan! I could not imagine how much food would be left on this pan if someone without great eyesight cleaned it. You have to go along each crevice on both sides of the grill gooves to get the food out. It is very time consuming and tedious and just not worth it. I wonder if the Calphalon pan is the same??? As far as the pot set I ended up buying-Analon Titanium 12 piece. Highly reccomend it
 While this was great to not scratch my non-stick pans, it melted while using it in an aluminum pan!  Would not recommend
 Pros: The oven part works great. I like the fact that it is controlled by a timer, meaning that you can set somthing to cook for 20 minutes and then it turns itself off.  For cooking things, the double rack is also handy, although you only get one pan (luckily, I saved the pan from my old toaster oven).  Pros: The oven part works great.

This thing burns my toast every time, unless I watch it carefully and take it out at precisely the right time.  Part of the problem seems to be that the timer doesn't work very well in small increments, and in some cases never turns itself off.  Also, the bottom rack is completely useless when toasting, so the fact that they are touting this as a 6-slice toaster oven is misleading. 
 The fan was great, with lots of breeze and circulation. It is loud, but who cared? The problem is that it only lasted for about 3 months before it just quit working, along with a little puff of smoke. Two weeks before the fatal puff, the fan arced, popped, sparked, and gave off a puff of smoke, but it still worked. Two weeks after that it sparked and puffed and has not turned on since.I live in Hawaii and it is currently in the rainy season. There has been a lot of humidity in the air during the last month, and I noticed that the back of the fan was actually getting rusty. I thought perhaps that moisture was the cause of the sparking so I was surprised to read in another review that the fan was good to use during heat and humidity!The fan was sitting in front of the living room window and it kept the whole small 2 bedroom house cool. We miss it, but I can't keep buying a new fan every 3 months! This is the first time ever that this has happened with a fan that I purchased. I have been living in Hawaii for 13 years and have been through a lot of fans. One of the best-lasting fans I had was a $10.00 Lasko box fan. It lasted and worked well for 7 years before it quit working
 Just bought this item this week, was very excited about using it for the first time. Turned out to be a huge mess. The stove turned black right under the grill, it took like 20 min to clean it up, burned up mess. Also there there is soo much smoke coming from the grill I had to shut off the smoke detector for a while. Overall the food came out pretty good but the mess with the stove really upset me.
 This product had the best reviews but the performance was not at all verygood. I found it very awkward to roll the litter box. You still have tobend down and tip the litter box all the way over to get the clumpsinto the pull out tray. And that's the clumps that aren't stuck in thelitter filter piece, which gets easily clogged and is not reallysomething I want to deal with cleaning. Besides not all clumps goinginto the tray, lots of unused litter ended up in the tray as well.Also, I bought the 'regular' size one and the filter piece goes almostright in the middle of the space so the usable cat space was verysmall. Needless to say I returned the litter box and was so glad tohave the old fashioned scoop litter box
 i own many kitchenaid appliances and love the brand. i even own a silicone muffin pan which i love. this pan, however, is terrible. the cake did not bake completely and i had a terrible time trying to get it out of the pan. (yes, i sprayed the pan effectively.) do not waste your money! stick to the metal pans
 This is a beautiful blue color, coordinates with my kitchen. However, I'll bake my poundcakes in my old, reliable metal pans. I tried to use this a few times, spraying every nook and cranny with Baker's Secret release spray. Without fail, each time the cake stuck to the pan in a few places.
 I loved the way the Vortex Digital Heater heated and the way it kept cool to the touch.  But within a week, the one I had started cutting off when it hit the set temperature and did not come back on.  I was worried that it was overheating all the time and called Vortex who told me I could send it in at my expense and pay $15 to fix it.  I emailed my Amazon seller (Louise at Pinnacle Packaging) who was wonderful and paid to have it sent back to her, and is going to refund my money.  I think I am going to buy another one only I am going to purchase it from a local store and make sure I can bring it back if the new one does the same thing.  I guess I am a sucker but I really liked the way the thing worked when it worked correctly
 good size, good color but way too stiff .I washed these 5 TIMES with no change
 I miss soy yogurts !!! I've been used to make soy yogurts in France. I've bought this yogurt maker. I've tried several times to make some but it never worked. I've followed the recipe using plain soy milk and one plain yogurt. Has anyone got a recipe for me ? I'm allergic to lactose...Thank you
 Bought this item last Christmas for my wife. Worked fine until this Thanksgiving when rubber bulb split apart when basting turkey. She had complained when I bought this fancy one to replace her old ugly plastic one last year but I insisted this was better. Boy am I in trouble now. Old plastic one had lasted for 10 years and cost 1/10 as much. Did not look like much but it did the job
 And bit the dust. I use it once a year for 3 days. I'm estimating it made coffee 10 times. Now it wont brew anything but weak coffee. If you fill it to 55 cups it takes about an hour to brew. Now it perks for 30 minutes and walla it makes the coffee weak. I was going to call Faberware and noticed they charge 95 cents per minute. For what? Like the last guy said it's an expensive way to make a cup of coffee. It's a throwaway. So,this time I'll buy the west bend for 35 bucks and when it stops working I'll throw it away. At least I wont be thrwing away 150 bucks
 I agree completely with the review by Terry Gruggen. As she said in her Feb review, "the cutting arm is attached to this indestructible case by an all too flimsy piece of plastic. A little extra pressure on the arm and this plastic attachment shatters....leaving you with a $49 die cast paper weight."Despite its rugged looks, the appliance was a real disappointment
 not incredibly impressed with it, but it does keep me warm for the price i paid. 
 The way specifications were mentioned it sounded a very good deal, and price comparision made it very promissing, but after getting the item I found item is a trash quality I have ever seen in my life. If someone give me a free item like this I won't take it. Don't fall for this deal. I am very disappointed with this item.
 I ordered this thinking that I'd save a bundle, and have a really nice comforter set. Not! The product description promised Navy and Sage, but it is Black and Sage. It is the cheapest looking comforter that I have ever seen. I sent mine back yesterday--I just can't let the seller get away with the totally inaccurate description and the deception in claiming that this product was originally $200+ dollars
 After operating the Petmate Fresh Flow Cat Fountain for a month my 2 cats won't go anywhere near it.  Very disappointing!
 This has been used twice.  The first time I used it, it made a great smoothie.  I tried to use it this past Independence day and the "pulse" stopped and started continuously.  After a while, something smelled like it was burning.  On the bottom, there appears to be lots of specks of metal.  Don't think I'll be buying a new one
 I used this smoothie machine once, and it made a nice smoothie.  The second time it locked up and I could smell something burning in the motor. I used the exact measurements for liquids and frozen fruit, so I'm confident I didn't do anything wrong.  I sent it back for a refund immediately. 
 We also bought the FCP12 after years of hearing from satisfied Farberware users. Unfortunately it only worked about three months until it also made lukewarm, tea - like coffee. I removed the bottom and wiggled the wires and it worked great for another month or so. After a few times of this monkey business, I contacted Farberware and was told I had voided my warranty by removing a single nut from the base. The best they could offer was a refurbished unit at half price. Shipping would be on me both directions as well, I told them I would not pay any price for another one of their products, based on our experience and their lack of any desire to acknowledge the widespread problem or help to fix it. I am going to try replacing the thermostat, as I like perked coffee, but I am not convinced it will last any longer, time will tell
 I never got to use this item.  I turned it on and for some reason the heat seemed transfered to the screws in the hinge.  It just fell apart and started smoking. The hinge was very cheaply made. I would not buy this product again.I never got to use this item.  I turned it on and for some reason the heat seemed transfered to the screws in the hinge.  It just fell apart and started smoking.

 Stainless-steel and die-cast aluminum construction promises performance, but the undersized electric motor limits this slicer to very light intermittent household use. The Waring FS800 Pro Electric Food Slicer seems to have a barely adequate motor when brand new with a new sharp blade. Just think how it will perform when the blade gets a little dull. This is definitely not a professional quality food slicer, it is only a light intermittent duty slicer at best
 This liner is non-slip which is nice and even home made chocolate chip cookies dont stick BUT....it looks dirty and baking residue is sticking to it even after I have put it in the dishwasher.  My other liner is a Chef's Planet Full size baking sheet non stick bakeliner and while it can slip a bit and dosn't have a "finished" edge it dose have the advantage of wipe-down clean up and it arrives in a large sheet that you custom cut to fit any baking sheet(s) you will be using it with.  Don't buy this liner but do buy the non stick bakeliner from Chef's Planet.  It's not as pretty but it works like a charm!  After years of buying expensive parchment paper I'll never go back.  Also, it's less wastfull to use a bake liner instead of disposable baking sheets or parchment paper
 I thought the four 4.5 inch springform pans would be equivalent to one 9.0 inch springform pan.  After all, the areas are equal, i.e. 4 * 2.25 * 2.25 * pi == 4.5 * 4.5 * pi.

 I used my Hoover Agility for the first time and the suction quit after 5 minutes. I followed all the trouble shooting instructions and it still didn't work. I called Hoover and spoke with a rep who was basically reading out of the manual. I sat on hold for 21 minutes only to hear a manager tell me that they cannot give out technical information because it's against their policy. I guess this is to ensure their Hoover service centers get the business. I'm returning the Hoover and NEVER purchasing a Hoover again. 
 The cutting boards are not silicone but have a thin layer of silicone sprayed over one side of another plastic that is not heat resistant.  I placed a hot pan on one and it melted onto the bottom of the pan which took a great deal of effort to clean the melted plastic off so the pan could be used again.  I prefer a thick cutting board so I bought these thinking that they were heat resistant so I wouldn't purchase them again
 I bought this back in 1999, and I love the way it cooks chicken and salmon steaks, but it's not built to last.  First, after about 3 years, the tracks where the door slips onto the bottom broke off due to the screws being too tight, and then the 5th year, the knob broke off, so I have to use pliers to turn it on.  It still cooks chicken great, but after trying to superglue the "feet" back on and the knob, they broke again right away.

I used the skewers once to cook some ribs, and they're so flimsy, that they kept falling off the spit from the weight of the ribs.I used the skewers once to cook some ribs, and they're so flimsy, that they kept falling off the spit from the weight of the ribs.I still use it, but I wouldn't buy a 2nd one after reading all the reviews.  I think I'll try a George Foreman one next time
 I really liked this spatula in the beginning, but after just 6 months of very gentle use its head developed cracks and chipped.
 After thoroughly checking toaster reviews and ratings (this got top ratings), I had to return it after several attempts to get it to produce evenly toasted bread.  Very disappointing; my old Toastmaster (much less expensive) does better.   
 We have not been able to use the sheets because they are so stiff and rough.  They are wrinkled and no matter how many times they are washed they do not soften.  The pillowcases are too narrow for our regular size pillows which makes the pillows too high and hard to be comfortable. We are totally dissatisfied and thoroughly disappointed and will be returning them if for no other reason than to get them out of the house.  We do like the color, though
 I was so excited to buy these sheets as my husband and I have 600 thread count sheets that we love. These, I DO NOT love so much. This is why:1. They are increadibly stiff. I washed them 5 times before my first use and even tried vinegar and salt washes to soften them- it did not work. They are, however, softening as we sleep on them.2. They are so wrinkley!!3. They barley fit the bed. The description says that is fits extra deep mattresses but it is a STRUGGLE to get them on my bed.3. They barley fit the bed. The description says that is fits extra deep mattresses but it is a STRUGGLE to get them on my bed.I just read consumer reports and they recommend that you buy between 400-600 thread count, they contend more than that is unnecessary for a soft, nice sheet. My 600 thread count sheets are much more soft and have very few wrinkles. Dont waste your money, buy something else
 Nice pattern, but you cannot find the glasses that go with it
 this breadmaker is not doing what I want.  It is so touchy, you have to be very very precise to be able to cook a reasonable bread loaf. I am not satisfied with the product and will try to return it.  also it works very noisy during dough process.look for something else if you want a breadmaker
 I was very surprised at how large this grill was when it arrived; way too large for my countertop at least;  it just seemed like more trouble than it was worth; it seemed easier for me to just broil food in the oven frankly; I mean the only thing you are going to get from using this grill is the grillmarks on your food; nothing can duplicate the flavor of cooking on an outdoors grill; the size turned me off as well as the inconvenience of using the product.  It is one of those products that you will use once or twice and then it will end up lost somewhere in your cabinets
 I bought this to simplify making fries, it was a disappointment. It takes a lot of effort to push through a potato, and when it does go through it most likely won't go straight. Either save your money and use a knife, or spend more and get a mandoline
 I found the following issues which put this purchase into the local landfill:I found the following issues which put this purchase into the local landfill:1.)

 After cooking eggs this morning and having a layer of egg stuck to the whole pan, I'm sad to say that my non-stick pan sticks.  We've had this pan for maybe 8 months and I just assumed that pans lasted for several years.  We even bought this pan plus the 8" for my mother-in-law for Christmas.  What a disappointment.  Better begin research on a new pan...and I'll make sure to read the reviews.   
 When I first bought this pan I was replacing a pan from a moderately priced set from Costco.  That pan lasted about 3 years and I got my money's worth.When I first bought this pan I was replacing a pan from a moderately priced set from Costco.

After doing some googling I have found that there is no email.  It is also basically impossible to get someone on the phone.  They sold their warranty service to a different company, All American Lighting in Berwick, PA.  As it turns out this company gets terrible feedback for their service.  If this isn't really Farberware what exactly is their incentive to provide good service?  You can check on consumeraffairs dot com and other places and you'll get an eyeful.  BUYER BEWARE
 After your pan starts sticking, you go to their web site to complain and you find .... A warning that you can't use high heat on this pan.  They warn you if you use high heat or some sprays, the pan will then start to stick.  Yes, you've just been ..... and you paid $40 for the privilege.  Imagine, a frying pan that doesn't like heat.  How much heat?  They don't tell you.  If your pan is sticking, then it must have been toooo much.  Buy at your own risk
 If you are planning to purchase anything from getapc.com, the markeplace vendor selling this item, beware.  I purchased the Delonghi 5-Quart mixer based on product description and customer reviews but found that it did not perform as expected.  It froze up kneading a 2-loaf batch of whole grain bread.  The design is beautiful and the mixer is probably good for non-artisan breads, but should you have any problems with it, you'll have to stay on the vendor to get any kind of response.  I am still waiting for a refund on the product after 2 weeks.  The last message I got was that "it may take a bit longer."  So be sure this is what you want before you buy it.  Returning it is not easy.  And getapc.com charges a $60 reshelving fee on top of the shipping you'll have to pay to send it back.  My markeplace experience has been very frustrating.  I won't buy through the marketplace again.  If amazon.com or getapc.com processes my refund in the next day or two, I'll feel better and will edit my review, but for now, buyer beware
 I purchased this product 4 years ago and have replaced the probe three times for about $7 each. The latest probe just malfunctioned.  I really loved it at first...perfectly roasted chickens,loin roasts, and turkeys.  Oddly enough, the thermometer works great but the probe itself isn't designed to handle much time in the oven.  If you like to roast your chickens in a hot 400 degree oven ,the probe will eventually stop working or will become completely unreliable.  Even at lower temperatures, the heat finally takes its' toll...it just takes longer for it to happen.  One would think that something designed to be left in the oven would be able to take the heat.  I will buy yet another probe because when this thing is working, it is great.  That is worth $7 a year for me....but not for everyone.  Per another reviewers advice, I am calling Polder
 This unit was a great addition until the probe went bad after only a few months.  Not recommended
 When it worked it worked well.  However, eight months into this -- and I only have used it maybe 6 or 8 times, it's broken.  I have not done anything to it, and one day the the display is just messed up.  I can see a line here and there, but nothing else.  Replacing the battery did not help and Polder's website offers no information such as warranty information.  It is defintely NOT worth $30
 I bought this air cleaner in March of 03 and was pleased with the thing until it just stopped working in January 04.  There was no indication that anything was amiss, I was changing the pre-filters on the recommended schedule and then one morning nothing; no lights, no sound, no activity.  Am sending it back to Honeywell (on my nickel according to their warranty policy).  We will see how long the replacement lasts.  I have read several reviews here that don't give me much hope.  Amazon was nice, said I needed to contact Honeywell directly but suggested I post a review
 I was dissapointed that this item arrived broken and I needed to send it back for a refund

 this item is priced wrong It is not in line with the other Calphalon item
 Considering all the bells and whistles on the coffeemaker itself,(all excessive, by the way) the carafes have much to be desired.  It seems as if they are made with spun sugar.  EXTREMELY FRAGILE, awkward handle and like a comment already listed, I too have replaced the carafe twice...making three so far.  My Krups carafe of 10 years is still intact.  If they still made the filters, I would still be using that machine.The Cuisinart coffee bean container is hard to clean, still maintains rancid oils and leaves an oil slick on the top of the coffee.  The carafe is poor at best
 Purchased this, expecting better functionality. Sure it doesn't rust, but my $5 Wustoff pealer works much better
 This sharpener seemed to work well, but that was before I noticed it was putting chips in the edge of the knife
 This chopper, if you can call it that, is terrible.  I've tried chopping all kinds of foods from veggies to fruit to nuts to cheese.  I've tried filling up the bowl, half full and barely anything at all.  It doesn't chop.  Plain and simple it just doesn't chop the food.  I've had pieces of vegetables get stuck on the blade.  Then, I'd have to stop and remove the piece and try again.  It started to chop a little a couple of times, but then just stopped and the blade kept spinning while chopping nothing.It was horrible and I've opted now for a bigger 7 cup Kitchen Aid or Cuisinart processor based on reviews here.Lesson learned, you get what you pay for
 I was so excited at the prospect of having a 3-cup mini chopper.  I thought it would be ideal for hummus, which I hate to scrape out of my blender.  However, it was very disappointing.  On either speed, it just seems to chop what is in the center, so the stuff on the inside stays on the inside and the outside stuff stays on the outside--unchopped.  If I wanted to take the lid off every two seconds and move everything around, I'd use the blender, no?  I nearly pureed some red pepper, trying to get it all chopped.  I have a 2 cup mini chopper (Procter-Silex, I think) that is really much better at consistent chopping.  I never had to take the top off of it.  Unfortunately, the bowl got warped in the dishwasher (even though it claimed to be dishwasher safe) and the lid does not fit tightly now, making an occasional mess with liquids and crumbs.  Still, even warped, I find myself using the old one instead of this new one--it is really that bad!
 Openning a dog food can is nearly impossible without at least 6 or 7 tries to get the blade to catch.  I bought it; I regret the purchase;  I threw it out. This really hurts the cuisinart image
 Dont plan on cutting anything you need a sharp knife for.  Other than that, it's ok
   This is a very nice small oven, but as a toaster it really drives me up the wall. As someone else said, three knobs to adjust just to make toast! Then you have to stand there and watch it and the toast still burns!  I will keep this to use as an oven, but tomorrow I am going out and buy a nice small toaster.  And guess what it will not be an Oster product. This is the  last of their products I shall ever purchase.  And guess what it will not be an Oster product.

 These towels are very poor quality! I guess I can use them to dry off my dogs. If you really want cheap almost see through towels these are the ones for you
 The coating does not last - extremely poor durability.  I've been very careful with this pan, using only wood or plastic utensils and washing by hand only.  Didn't matter - within just a few uses, the coating flaked off and the edges on the underside are rusting.  Waste of money
 I received two of these baking sheets for Christmas last year; by March, 1/3 of the teflon was gone in spots.  By July, it was coming off in sheets when washed.  These Never went through the dishwasher; always hand washed.  I threw them away and purchased Baker's Secret which seems to be satisfactory so far
 I would never buy this product again. The finish came off almost immediately. Don't waste your money
 I REALLY loved this baking sheet when I first got it, so I was supremely disappointed when the nonstick coating began flaking off, essentially rendering it unusable. I may have gotten a bad batch or something. The product has a lifetime warantee and I do intend to send it back in, but wanted to let folks know about my experience
 Have been using the set for less than a month. Rust has started to form on the knives just where the blades are fused to the handles - right at the seams. Looks like rust starts from the inside of the handle. Unless design is changed, don't know how replacement knives will be any different. Too bad since knives are sharp and set is designed beautifully
 I bought these plates after I already had the rest of the matching dishes. I already knew that I was not pleased with them but had to complete my set of dishes and will have to tolerate them as long as they last. They are really sturdy and go with everything BUT they get the 'knife-marks' - grey scratch marks from utensils scraping them. I imagine that there are white dishes out there somewhere that are not subject to this flaw, and if there are I hope to find them, but these are not them
 I thought this was the answer to my crock-pot prayers!  I received it for Christmas and was heart broken to realize that you can choose high for 4 or 6 hours or low for 8 or 10 hours.  (Look at the product image enlarged) Most things I cook take 6 hours on low!  I occasionally have something that needs 8 hours but most of the time it is 6 to 7 hours.  Unfortunately, if it doesn't do the time you need, it is completely useless.  You would have to be home to turn it off or down.  So I returned it and am making do with my Select Brands corningware programmable, (it doesn't do 6 hours on low either) and a regular 3 quart.  I just make it home in time or I don't cook it
 I found this sealer to be difficult to use.  It is very difficult to get a good vacuum seal due to the clumsy method of putting the bags in a nozzle.  Extreme pressure is needed to hold down and lock the top in order to create the vacuum and seal the bag.  If you let up on the pressure, the vacuum seal is broken.  I returned mine and would never buy another Rival sealer product again
 I accidentally ruined my father's old baking stone so I bought this on for him to replace it. Everything sticks to it! We thought maybe it just needed to be seasoned a bit before it stopped sticking. We've had it for over a month and we use it at least four times a week and it continues to make a mess out of anything we bake on it. That's not even the worst of it. It puts out a disgusting smell in the oven. Just last night we used it and had to sit it in the garage and open up the entire house because we all had headaches and our eyes burned from whatever fumes it was releasing. I definitely DO NOT recommend this item.
 I thought that 1200 thread count meant really soft.....while these sheets are really thick, they feel like sand paper.  If you're looking for soft sheets, don't buy these. 
 Even though I cleaned the machine between each empty and fill, if I did not have white carpet I would not have known this machine leaks the dirty water back onto the carpet. I had to shampoo the carpet two more times to remove the extra spots left in the carpet. A second time with detergent to remove the spots and then immediately with a rinse only cycle. My second gripe is the clean and dirty water reservoirs are in the same small space. I had to change it out about every 10 minutes. The machine gets one star for the dual brushes which I think are a positive for this machine. Unfortunately, that was not enough for me to keep it. It would have been cheaper for me to hire someone to come in and steam clean my carpet considering the fact I had to clean it three times and this carpet is in a low traffic area. I've had a Hoover for 8-10 years and will look to see what new machines Hoover has on the market.
 The V2 is one of the worst built appliances ever especially at about $250. Without exaggeration I have been back to the parts dealer about 10 times for replacement of the front suction piece (breaks), a number of times for the clear water and soap dispenser assembly. It seems to fall apart, leak, and requires constant attention. I now have to go to have a repair of the brushes - they don't rotate. And this is with use maybe once a month. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to manufacture and sell a product with such miserable (and expensive) quality
 These were sent instead of the black-handled set I ordered so I thought I would give them a try. They are listed as "dishwasher safe", but evidently are not. Brown stains (rust?) appeared on the tops of all the handles. I cleaned them with silver polish, but the stains reappeared with subsequent washings. I have returned them and received a refund

 After very little use one of the glasses inner lining broke and is unusable
 I liked the mug's look, feel, & size. Then I took a drink of java from this mug... I never could get a lip lock on this mug. The rim is very thin & very wide. It would always spill a couple of drops on my shirt. Nissan mugs have what I call a "lip ledge" that prevents the "dribble" effect to which the Bodum is prone. Nissan mugs also have a much smaller diameter rim which also makes drinking from them less hazardous to my white shirts
 This product did not even approach what was described.  A bagutte pan needs to have a decent-sized curvature so a bagutte shape will be obtained.  This pan would have produced a fairly flat loaf
 I am really dissapointed with this bread machine!I had a panasonic 1 lb. breadmaker which I loved--but wanted a machine with a bigger loaf capacity. Never had any problems with the smaller panasonic, and received the Oster 5838 fo Christmas and have had nothing but bad experience--how many times do you have to experiment with the thing to get a good loaf of bread--like the Panasonic, you should be able to follow the instructiona and get a good loaf of bread!!We also gave 2 of these for gifts --and really feel bad as they are a pain--all 3 are going back!
 it's just bad looking plastic. if you want expresso buy nespresso machine with capsules
 Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst. Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking.

 My wife and I purchased the 40616 Hamilton Beach Perculator at K-Mart. After only 8 months of service the perculator would not keep the coffee hot--only luke warm.K-Mart refused to do anything about the problem because they only warranty the coffee pot for 90 days. This should give you an idea of what K-Mart thinks of the quality of the Hamilton Beach 40616 perculator.When I  called Hamilton Beach customer no-service I was told to send in the cord from the coffee pot and a check for $9.95 and they would replace their defective equipment. The $9.95is 25% of the original price of the perculator so I will decline their offer. If their perculator only last for 8 months I don't even want to pay the $9.95 to get a new one. I feel that it should have been replaced for free! In their warranty booklet they tell you that the 40616 perculator has a limited 2-year warranty but that is only if you are willing to pay $9.95 to ship their defective equipment back to them. Because of this experience with the Hamilton Beach 40616 coffee perculator I will never purchase any Hamilton Beach equipment in the future.I will also not purchase anything else from K-Mart
 I feel it was an unlucky day when I bought this pot.  As careful as I tried to be, it was extremely difficult to tell if I had correctly placed the stem (with basket) in the pit.  It had to be by "feel," and half the time it was apparently a hair's breadth off and would not perk.  Or it would perk enough so that the light went on but that the coffee grounds were hardly wet.  It was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot.  A hair's breadth off and again it wouldn't perk.  So each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day I got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds.  I am returning to my old friend, the Farberware FC280.  It may or may not last more than a year but at least I can depend on it
 Not much to say about this item it sucks. very thin and cheap made. Does not seal at all and does not keep the bread freah This is the worst product i have every got from Amazon.
 I agree with the previous reviewers.  The style is quite sleek and the ceramic, earthen material eliminates the metallic taste of the water.  I agree with the previous reviewers.

 Why would anyone want pots that can't be used on high heat, can't be washed in the dishwasher or can't be scoured for fear of removing their anodized finish.

I have noticed that many of the positive reviews were by people who haven't owned these pots for longI am a real cook and use my pots several times a day, I need them to work, not just look good and this cookware is ridiculously tempermental.  After leaving them on the heat too long, just once, they warp.  Food sticks easily to them and they are very hard to clean because you can't use steelwool or abrasive pads.  After a guest put one in a dishwasher by mistake, the pot finish was ruined, and I had aluminum coming off on my food.  I am someone who takes good care of my things, and it is impossible to clean these well without removing the finish.  I had taken some  comfort in the "lifetime" warantee, I tried to return them, but the warantee, like this cookware is absolutely useless
 I just received this knife yesterday &amp; am sending it back for a refund.  Upon first use, the forked metal tip broke off when I was chopping tomatoes for a salad.  It took me a few moments to notice the lost tip (as it had ended up in the salad I was preparing.)  Could have been very dangerous to swallow a sharp metal tip!  The knife itself is flimsy, can't imagine that it could cut a bagel very well
 I folowed the instructions and found that the coffee was very weak so I experimented with differint grinds and filter no filter. I found not useing the paper filter and grinding the coffee expresso and stoping the water when it starts to look pale makes a med. strong cup. A lot of work for a decent cup. I still think that my old krups drip makes a great cup. I will keep trying other alternets to the pods becous there very expensive. I am waiting for some one to start manufacturing a home pod maker. that you can fill & seel at home

Ilove the taste of the coffee and it does give a fair amount of foam but hard to clean.  I saw the Presto MyPod and leaped to try it. The coffee overfills the cup making it too weak and no room for creamer.  There is absolutely no foam. I got hooked on the Senseo Foam.  We will use it in a pinch but only on the 1 cup setting with 1 1/2 scoops
 I thought that this would actually be something that I would need when I registered for this for my wedding. But this is more of a toy for the kitchen than something that you will actually use. Sure kids might like to use it when they cook, but in all the time that I have owned one, I have only used it once. Its more of a hassle because you have to clean it out afterwards. You are better off without it
 It may work O.K. for melons, but the handle is extremely uncomfortable and ackward to grip when attempting to scoop ice cream.  In addition, the shape of the scoop bowl makes it difficult to get a full scoop of ice cream
 I bought this coffee maker to match my KitchenAid blender and coffee gridner. The coffee maker is attractive but works terribly. If you make more than 1 or 2 cups it overflows hot coffee onto the counter top. There is almost always grounds in the coffee too. When I called KitchenAid customer service they said they made a revision to fix the problems and sent me another one. It has the same problems. This is NOT user error I have tried different coffees, grinds, and positioning the carafe differently. This coffee maker is just a distrastrous design mistake. Finally I got KitchenAid to buy the coffee maker back and got a Cuisinart one. It works perfectly, costs less, and has more features. I would recommend Cuisinart and highly recommend that you do not buy this shoddy coffee maker - you will regret it.
 I have several other Kitchen Aid appliances and they are all great - solid, hefty machines that do superior work, the type of items Kitchen Aid has built a reputation on.  So that is why I bought this coffee maker (actually I have the previous model before this "update").  Boy, howdy!  Was I blind-sighted!  The quality of the housing is no better than a Mr. Coffee for 1/4 the price, and I too, have experienced the leaking problems like other reviewers have noted.  And on mine, the spring that keeps the shut off unit down while you take the pot off the machine to have that first cup while it is still brewing - well, it decided to not do it's job only after about a month of owning it.  The unit leaks coffee as if that is what it was designed to do.  HEY, KITCHEN AID ENGINEERS - DO YOU READ THESE AMAZON REVIEWS?  IF YOU DO, THEN GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND MAKE A COFFEE MAKER THAT IS IN LINE WITH YOUR OTHER PRODUCTS!  AND GIVE THOSE OF US THAT BOUGHT YOUR PREVIOUS JUNK A FULL CREDIT TRADE IN TO UPGRADE TO IT ONCE IT IS AVAILABLE!  HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE A GOOD COFFEE MAKER?  MY GRANDMA'S EARLY 70'S MR. COFFEE IS STILL PERKING STRONG - WHAT AN EMBARASSMENT TO KITCHEN AID.  Nuff' said
 I got this on sale from Targets for $35.  Eagerly I plugged in the unit, turned the variable dial to maximum steam, and increased the digital dial to  7.  And then I waited, and waited, and waited, for 10 minutes.  The iron never warmed up, let alone hot enough to iron anything.  I can't say this is a bad product, but surely I got a non-working unit
 This iron worked splendidly for over year before almost catching on fire while I was using it.  I was pressing a shirt when suddenly the LED display on the iron shut off and started beeping repeatedly.  I smelled smoke and the handle was hot to the touch.  I lifted the iron off my shirt to discover a dark scorch mark ON MY BRAND NEW SHIRT!This iron worked splendidly for over year before almost catching on fire while I was using it.

 Both pads "burned" on the backside the first time I used them.  They are still serviceable, but the "burned" areas are hard.  They were used in a normal kitchen--no blow torches
 Be careful to buy products from compact appliance. They will not be responsible if the product is defective from the manufacturer. There is no return. You better think more than twice before you buy from compact appliance. They have the worst customer service including the manufacturer Edgestar.I agreed completely with the previous customer review that it is hard to get in touch with Edgestar customer service, which has the worst product I ever bought.
 Box arrived damaged. Opened product, scratched on front, dirty on the inside. After I cleaned it up it worked great for a week then "poof". No power at all. Thought I may have ran it too much so I left it unplugged for 24 hours then plugged it back in and NOTHING. Additionally customer service for Edgestar is TERRIBLE. I have left 10 voicemails and sent approx 14 e-mails back and forth with their customer service (haha) reps and still have made zero progress. Buy with caution
 I ordered this cake plate and dome for my mother, shortly before Thanksgiving of 2002. The first time it arrived, after 3 weeks, it was in about 1,000 pieces. The UPS driver realized that upon delivery and returned the item. When it was sent the second time, which wasn't until around Christmas, it arrived with the handle to the dome broken off. So, long story short, no cake plate for Mom! Amazon.com should really examine how they pack items like this
 I wanted to like this toaster.  It looks nice, seems sturdy enough, and stays cool to the touch.  But it toasts poorly.  One side of the bread toasts more than the other.  So I have to pop up the toast 1/2 way through and turn it over.  And now the pop up mechanism isn't working well
 If you prefer having bread that is toasted on both sides look elsewhere for a toaster. Even when it is not on the bagel "setting" it does not do any more than barely warm one side of bread.In addition if you are looking for a blue toaster (how I wound up with this one despite the warnings about its inefficiency) don't buy this one--it looks nothing like the picture on the internet. It is purple, so not only does it perform poorly it looks terrible in my blue/gray kitchen.I expected more from a KitchenAid product and if I could return a used toaster (albeit only 3 times) I certainly would.
 As soon as I opened it and tried to remove the lid for cleaning, it broke! No instructions provided on how to remove, replace the removable parts
 I finally gave up after trying three of the Hunter fans and got my money back.  Even on the lowest speed, this thing rattles, shakes, and groans.  I own five Hunter ceiling fans, which are great.  This fan doesn't deserve the Hunter nameplate
 I like the cookware.  Solid as Calphalon always is, If you follow the link on the Bonus item, it shows a 1-2 day availability.  Today is Dec 26, ordered on Nov 9.  Still waiting for the bonus. 
 I had older 500 thread count sheets that were better, lighter, smoother.  These feel like 200 thread count sheets.  Complete waste of money
 This Fork Thermometer would have been great if it had lasted more than 3 usages.  No way to notify the manufacturer to find out "why" the fork quit working.  It's still useful as a meat fork, but not as a thermometer. Very disappointing and a bit expensive to be used only as a fork.
 I bought T-fal's top of the line Avantis iron even though I only have light ironing to do. It broke in less than a year - losing heat completely. T-fal would not stand behind it. I wrote to them several times. They insisted on the original sales receipt despite the fact I had the charge on my American Express bill. They had no technical advise either. Read other Amazon reviews on their products breakdowns! I've paid half as much for irons that lasted for years. Avoid this turkey and this company. I'll never buy another T-fal product and neither should you
 A normal coffee maker requires a quick rinse; this machine requires a wash, rinse and a thorough drying of the grinding unit.  You can't just rinse the grinding unit because the fine coffee grounds need to be washed out.A normal coffee maker requires a quick rinse; this machine requires a wash, rinse and a thorough drying of the grinding unit.

 A friend bought a food saver by Tilia and told me that it would be wonderful for storing my bulk shopping in the freezer.  I saved for it and got it.  I used it a total of 10 times and not for long periods of time and it literally died.  I sent it back to the factory asking for a refund and they refused and sent me a refurbished one in return - they will not refund your money on the poor quality items they sell.  Just be careful and do not let this happen to you - Tilia looks much better on TV than it performs in real life. 
 The top portion of the freezer works great.  The bottom drawer portion sounded great - no more digging to see what's at the bottom.  The reality is that the bottom drawer is only useful as overflow from my refrigerator. I don't put anything in that part that I'm not willing to store at regular refrigerator temperatures.  It's a disappoinment
 the product is an average product, do not think it is a top seller, another retailer has the same item cheaper..  the delivery and customer service is the wrost I have ever experienced.... would not order this item again with the poor delivery. 
 The holes are really small. This grater is suitable for hard cheeses like Romano, but forget using it for a softer cheese like cheddar.
 This product simply does not work.  The vacuum is so weak that it does not preserve the wine, even for a day.  I have used a Vacuvin for many years and it is a far superior product at a far lower cost.  We bought this item because it appeared to be easier to pump than the Vacuvin -- and it is.  The reason:  it doesn't preserve the wine.  I am seeking a return and refund, either through Amazon or Metrokane
 I honestly liked the blender a lot.  I received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen's KitchenAid appliances-- range, refrigerator, dishwasher, pretty much everything other than the toaster oven.  At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid's brand and durability behind it.  I honestly liked the blender a lot.

I use my blender for making tomato sauce and the occasional fruit smoothie.  There is some amount of ice crushing required, but that shouldn't be an issue.  I certainly was not a weekly let alone a daily user.  So, 3 years after I got the blender, I went to turn it on and it is completely dead-- no light on the on button.  Changed outlets and still nothing.  It's done.  What an incredible dissappointment.I use my blender for making tomato sauce and the occasional fruit smoothie.

 Mine broke and started SMOKING while I was making hummus (not even something tougher like ice).  Kitchenaid won't fix it.  There are many MUCH cheaper but nicer ones on the market
 I find that such a well-known brand would have a longer warranty than 12 months. My blender broke (it was the "coupler") after about 18 months of use. I emailed KA about it and all they did was give me two repair shops where I could pay to have it fixed. Both repair shops are more than one hour away. They also offered me [...] off a "refurbished" blender. Gee...what service. You'd think they'd at least work with me since the blender wasn't even 2 years old. For [...] I went out and bought a Cuisinart and that comes with a 3 year warranty. KA blender was not worth my [...]. It never blended fruit all the way, either; it always left chunks of bananas
 My husband sweats a lot at night and I thought this would stop the problem.  It didn't at all.  It doesn't seems like it does anything for me either.  It just feels like a normal mattress pad.  Not exactly worth the price for a normal mattress pad
 I just purchased a glass top stove and bought this because of the protective bottom. However, after using it several times, I would choose a different grill because of the following reasons:#1 The spatter mess - there is virutally no way to prevent splatter when using this pan creating an unneccessary amount of post-cooking clean-up.#2 There is no option of purchasing a lid#3 The pan itself has an odd rectangular shape that does not fit on one burner or two for that matter. Thus, somewhere while cooking you have a cool spot
 We've had 3 sets in just over 1-1/2 years.  Return policy is great but it's a hassle.  Can't Oneida make silverware that doesn't rust?  I'm going to try a different brand
 I have numerous Le Creuset items, and this has to be the worst one.  Everything sticks to the finish.  Salsbury steak turns out horrible (can't make gravy), breakfast sausage patties become ground sausage pieces due to the sticking.  And, like mentioned in an earlier post, it is hard to clean.  Beware this new finish, (they have it on their grill pans also)it is not up to par
 I'm a huge fan of Le Cruest's products and own a few well chosen pieces. Having said that, this new satin finish is a disappointment. I was given this a gift a year ago and was thrilled  - until I used it. I'm a huge fan of Le Cruest's products and own a few well chosen pieces. Having said that, this new satin finish is a disappointment. I was given this a gift a year ago and was thrilled  - until I used it. I really wish they'd go back to their original smooth enamel finish. This must be an attempt to produce an interior more durable for using metal utensils with. An attempt that in my opinion is a failure. Things (like eggs and hamburgers) stick to this finish. You have to use a lot more fat to prevent sticking. It's hard to get clean, takes quite a bit of scrubbing even after soaking. It doesn't give the finish to grilled meats, etc that I want from a fry pan. Forget deglazing it to make a sauce. I find my All Clad 9 inch skillet to be a superior performer to this one.I really wish they'd go back to their original smooth enamel finish.

I do use it to make cornbread and to roast small portions of meats or veg in the oven, with good results (as long as I'm not going to use the browned bits to make a sauce). This to me though, is not enough uses to justify buying it.
 Door advance feature broke after several weeks. Lower heating element broke after six months. Customer service refused to stand behind the product, stating that the warranty was expired. Note to buyer- warranty is one year from time of manufacture- NOT the date you actually receive it as a gift or purchase it. The knobs on the unit are like a child's toy- cheap and plastic. This is a highly disappointing product- I doubt we will buy another Delonghi product again
 The second one came today. It is also dead on arrival.Do not bother with this one
 I, too, own several KitchenAid products and have been delighted with previous products. When I needed a new coffee maker, I decided to switch brands to KitchenAid based on prior history with the company.I, too, own several KitchenAid products and have been delighted with previous products.

 I'm usually a big fan of KitchenAid appliances and I own a Proline coffee grinder, which is excellent. But, I could not get a good full-flavored cup of coffeee out of this machine. I usually brew 4 cups at a time. They have a setting for 1-4 cups, but the coffeee still turned out slightly weak and slightly bitter. I returned it and will try something else
 I love Kitchenaid products, but this one failed miserably!!The taste of the coffee is excellent, but there were grounds and coffee everywhere.  The Pause N Serve feature works as it brews!!  I don't think that was the intention though.  When I called the company the not so brilliant guy told me that they hear this all the time on this model and that you just have to push the coffee maker in far enough so that the pause n serve feature isn't activated...well, unless we put a heavy ceramic bowl in front of the carafe to hold the pot in place we have coffee soup all over our counter and floor.

 The salesclerk told us that because of previous model recalls, that the new KitchenAid was sure to be a huge improvement, especially with it's price tag.  We've tried 2 models and both had problems with error messages.  The manual's suggestions do nothing to eliminate this.  Also, we've had the same trouble with coffee spewing out.  For the price tag, this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker.  We finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model (NOT KitchenAid).  Oddly enough, our other KitchenAid appliances (range and fridge) have also had electronic problems.  I wonder what the quality control is on the parts that are being cheaply manufactured, no doubt, in some overseas location.  I wouldn't recommend KitchenAid to anyone, regardless of the nice styling and supposed high-quality.The salesclerk told us that because of previous model recalls, that the new KitchenAid was sure to be a huge improvement, especially with it's price tag.

 This Krups espresso maker leaves water and steam all over the counter every time it is used. I think the "built in safety" features are to blame. The finer the grind, the more water leaked out.

 I jumped on purchasing this machine when I saw it. I was tired of storing beans in the freezer. I put 4 AA batteries in it and a pound of beans, closed the lid and the sucking sound started...and it kept going, and kept going, and kept going. I started looking for places to store it so that it wouldn't wake me up at night or disturb me with it's annoying hum first thing in the morning. But I didn't have to worry, but the next morning the batteries were dead. I replaced them and within 24 hours they were all dead again!  There is no place to plug it in so you're stuck with using batteries. I'm going to try buying rechargables but I don't know how long I'm going to want to keep this replacement going!!I jumped on purchasing this machine when I saw it.

I found it interesting that after I post my negative review three 5 star reviews appear from people who have no review history and NONE of them address the battery issue. Sur La Table, is sending me a new unit but told me that they received an identical complaint about the battery life. Be wary.  I'll try to update you
 I have two Roomba's, after one year of good operation they have been having battery problems.  One Roomba was returned for refurbishment.  They have good customer service, if you pursue them.  The newly returned Roomba still has battery problems.  The housekeeper which was very excited when I bought the Roomba now uses the vacuum cleaner.  
 Amazon took over a month in shipping me this roomba battery. It works ok. Also the list price is too high on this Amazon site.
 What a shame that this appliance fails at its sole purpose in life.  Let's hope there's a support group for mediocre toasters

 A well made no frills percolator.  It packs well,is quite simple to use and makes a great cup of coffee.  The ideal coffee pot for camping or outdoor use.  A superior product compared to the many flimsy coffee pots made for campers
 I would have given this no stars but it won't let me. This non-stick griddle has more things stick to it than tape.  It is simply the worst product I have purchased in a long time.  I have this "non-Stick" griddle for just about a month and it is ready for the trash.  The non-stick is coming up on the flat end and the griddle is worthless, it ripped my chicken cutlets to shreds.  Don't buy it!!! If you read this and still buy it may you have three horrible meals like I did before it met the old trash can
 FYI, those of you with square burners will not like this one. It is not stable because of the design, which is clearly meant for round burners.
 The sheets arrived soft and after washing stayed colorfast but shrunk.  They were difficult to get on the mattress
 After one wash the fitted sheet shrank and color leeched onto it so it has grey splotches in places. We don't even have a deep mattress but now the bare mattress shows on the sides. It'll have to go in our next garage sale.
 I purchased this about 1 year ago and it's only taking up space in my house.  It has very poor suction on carpeting.  Works O.K. on hardwood floors but then again most of these will.  I expected better force.  The small openning may look "cool" but it doesn't allow for wide enough sweeping area and I find myself going over the same area again and again.  Also, the charging holder is a little harder to place the unit in.  I would consider look at others first
 The convenience tempted me to try this for $20 at my local grocery. Poorly executed & constructed, the pods were too expensive & bland. Will be donating this to charity

 I am on my third machine now, and it too is leaking.  Dont get me wrong, the coffee tastes really good, always fresh.  But after a while the machine starts to leak when you are making a cup of coffee.  I guess the machine only cost 25 bucks now, so if you dont mind only using it for a month it is a great buy
 I bought this cookie press to make my favorite Christmas cookies-Spritz.  I got the dough into the gun, squeezed the handle, kept squeezing the handle, and nothing.  The mechanism that was supposed to push the dough out thru the disk kept slipping, and hence, no cookies.  It was very frustrating, having everything ready to make the cookies, but with no way to properly form them.  I would not recommend this cookie press
 This is a disapointment for me. I ordered these sheets in white, and recieved ivory. (unlike other reviewers I am not talking about a tinge of ivory, my package said IVORY instead of WHITE.) I would return these sheets, but they are a gift for my mother, and since they took so long to ship, I won't have time to get her anything else! I have never had a bad experience with Amazon products, some of the third party sellers could be better, but usually Amazon it's self is pretty good. Not in this case! The sheets do feel nice, and hopefully they work out for my mother, but I am keeping my paperwork and packaging just incase she runs into any problems!Buyer Beware: $200 dollar sheets for $30 is TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
 We purchased the George Foreman 8 in 1 with the thought we would get the toaster oven we needed and some other features that would be nice to have.  The 8 in 1 does have alot of neat features, the issue is it doesn't do any of the features very well.  The toaster feature takes about 2 times as long to toast as a smaller, more conventional toaster oven.  The Rotisserie is difficult to use and the grease catcher woefully inadequate.  We found out the hard way when we had chicken grease overflow out of the grill and onto the counter.  I can see this being a very good item for those with very small kitchens and in need of saving space, however, be warned that this oven has many shortcomings
 Fiesta Scarlet is a beautiful color and the Sugar and Creamer with Tray is really great.  Mine arrived broken and I had difficulty returning it so I remain disappointed and unwilling to try again.
 Definitely not up to typical Cuisinart standards. While the roaster is a nicely polished stainless which makes for easy cleanup, it's relatively thin. In a 400 degree oven, the pan actually bows.Definitely not up to typical Cuisinart standards. While the roaster is a nicely polished stainless which makes for easy cleanup, it's relatively thin.

 I don't know what the other reviewers of this blender are blending...but this blender is junk.  I have tried twice to make smoothies with it and this blender cannot do the job.  All of the ingredients just sit there while the only part of the mix being blended is at the very bottom.  So, you have to keep stirring and stirring and stirring the mixture to get it all incorporated.  And then try adding the crushed ice.  This blender is going back.I don't know what the other reviewers of this blender are blending...but this blender is junk.

 We purchased a DeLonghi toaster oven and both the toaster and oven functions stopped working right after the one year warranty expired. We barely used this product. When contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us. My $20 toastmaster lasted more than 15 years! This is the lsat time I buy a toaster based on appearance
 I received the DeLonghi XR640 Toaster Oven and was disappointed to find it unuseable. The wire rack inside was such a tight fit, it took 2 hands to pull it out! After a few times doing this, the enamel finish was starting to come off, which would soon result in rusting metal. I never turned it on, just returned it immediately.
 I've been happy with many other KitchenAid products, but this one is pure junk. The pasta roller attachment that KitchenAid also offers is great, but the width of it is so close to the size of this ravioli press, that the edges of the ravioli barely have enough dough to seal - and many of them pop open.I've been happy with many other KitchenAid products, but this one is pure junk.

 Firstly this set arrived with the small lid broken.  Amazon of course sent a replacement set but then the large lid was broken on that one.  I now have my full set however it feels kind of thin and fragile.  It's an ok buy but when the time comes to replace them I'll be looking for something a bit more durable
 While the combined grinding and making of the coffee in one unit is a great idea, the mess that it created was a pain to clean up each day.  The grounds would get caked in on all three removal parts and each part needed to be cleaned before using again.  I had the product three months and it quit working.  The good thing is that when we call Cuisinart's 800 number, they told us to just return the item to the store that we purchased it at and we got our money back. 
 I think it is ALMOST a great idea! It would be super if made of glass. I don't want to be concerned with material for which I use it! I would buy a couple if made of glass, otherwise not
 For approximately six months I owned this knife.  I used it everyday as it far outshined my other henkel chefs knife in balance, cutting efficiency and need for regular sharpening.  Until a few weeks ago when I was peeling a clove of garlic with the knife.  Lo and behold...I know have a two inch blade attached to the handle and five inches of steel sitting on the countertop.  I am currently looking for other brands of this knife style as I was unhappy with the manufactures complete lack of response regarding my complaint
 Every time I use the pan is twists as soon as it gets hot. It makes it very difficult to cook on and to move in and out of the oven.  The non stick surface comes off very easily too.Every time I use the pan is twists as soon as it gets hot. It makes it very difficult to cook on and to move in and out of the oven.

 I completely agree with the other reviewers.  This product is so bad.  It warps under the heat, the not-so-non-stick surface peels, and food sticks like glue
 I have used the steamer once, and was disappointed at how long it took. The steam comes out weakly and splattered water on the garment several times. I was just trying to take the store creases out of a new pair of lightweight cotton trousers, and it took a lot of going over to get it done. I used to have a small hand steamer that put out a real blast of steam and worked much faster. This one will probably work on heavier material like drapes, but it will take a very long time. I wouldn't buy it if you plan to use it for anything other than very delicate items, and it seems like a lot of equipment to lug out for that job. A hand unit makes more sense to me, and you wouldn't have to maneuver that long hose. This is just one more large thing to store. I wish I could return it to Wal-mart, but will probably give it away and buy something that is easier to use
 I hate to iron and despise the cost of dry cleaning...so, I was really excited when I saw this steamer at CVS.  It was reasonably priced and sounded wonderful.  I was bragging about how much I loved this steamer after using it just once!  It was easy and fast....then, the second time I used it---Water everywhere!

 I am a trained research assistant; therefore, I try to research products before I purchase them.  In the case of this purchase, I saw the item during an early bird sale at Kohls, so I grabbed it.  I owned a professional steamer that was purchased at a store that was going out of buisness, but it is really bulky, so I thought that the compact steamer would be a great choice.  On the contrary, it was a big waste of time trying to dewrinkle a blouse, and although it was on sale, it was a waste of money.

The nozzle would not reach to the top of the door, and I live in a mobile home, so it is not like I have the tallest doors in a home.1.

The most important thing in steaming a garment, for me, is to avoid the garment getting wet.  I did not fill the steamer to the maximum line, because I know from past experience that this could sometime cause the spitting affect.  After 2 minutes of waiting for the steam, I began to try it out on a silk blouse, and what a big mistake I made.  The water spat out on the material.  I thought that I should not hold the nozzle so close, but it did not matter, because water continued to spit out on the blouse.2.

I dabble in selling clothing on another website, and I have owned my other steamer since 2002, and I will continue to use it; I will just have to deal with space that it takes up in my home.  Conair GS4 Compact is a bust.
 This is a dangerous steamer. Sometimes it will pour steaming water and burn you badly. definitely  not recommended. I am throwing mine away
 This is NOT Aubergine, a dark purple like the color of eggplant skin, but it is a light, bright purple. Sitting on my kitchen countertop, it is a very formidable sight first thing in the morning; glowing, shimmering in kitchen flourescent lighting. Caveat emptor, unless you're color blind or really like bright purple
 Threw it in the trash!  It was AWFUL!!  Horrible to clean, didn't chop right.  PASS ON THIS ONE!!  Bought an unknown brand for $9.99 and love it
 I've been using a large Cusinart for over 10 years.  It is marvelous, so I decided to get the mini-mate chopper for smaller jobs.I've been using a large Cusinart for over 10 years.  It is marvelous, so I decided to get the mini-mate chopper for smaller jobs.WRONG IDEA!!  This is a horrible little machine.  It won't grind more than a couple of seeds at a time & forget chopping!  The grinding unit won't rotate most of the time.  It's going to the Salvation Army as a donation. 
 I strongly agree with the last reviewer- this unit is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED.  I also have a all-metal zinc alloy unit that included 2 extra worms, aluminum foilcutter, stainless steel bottle stopper and pourer and gift box for $25.  This one, at $150, still has a plastic body
 I bought this blender to make pie pastry, and I was thoroughly disappointed. The wires don't cut because they just widen and the pieces of butter slip through..I spent a lot of muscle to obtain a very poor result. The handle is nice but it just doesn't get the job done
 I just bought this toaster (not on Amazon) to replace a Black&Decker toaster oven that had served well for more than 10 years.  This new toaster oven burst into flames when making toast filling my house with rank smoke and nearly setting my kitchen cabinets ablaze.  This is a very dangerous appliance that, based on my experience and other reviews here, should probably be taken off the market and recalled
 This item fell apart the moment I took it out of the box.  The sides literally came apart.  Do not buy this product.  The company should be ashamed for even selling it
 We have only been using the sheets for 2 months and it is already pilling (balling up) very badly.  It is already affecting my husbands sleep so we are on a search for another sheet set.  When you see 500 thread count, you expect more from the sheet but I guess we should have know what to expect given the low price.  I suppose you get what you pay for.  Take my advice and don't throw away this $$
 I agree with the previous reviewer that these are difficult to clean and dry.  I could never get mine really clean so I threw them out
 Although I like the concept of these storage containers, they crack very easily.  The bottom of one of the largest containers had cracked during shipping. (Still useable for dry things like flour)  Then as I was sitting on the floor putting the containers away in a bottom cabinet, I dropped on from 1-2 feet above a linoleum floor -- it too chipped and cracked at the point of impact.  Also, when I first unpacked the containers, one of the lids came apart and the bottom half became stuck in the container.  We had to use a knife/fork and 2 people to pry it out, doing some damage in the process.  I believe the Click Clack folks have developed a second or even third generation of these containers.  Perhaps they are sturdier.  On the positive side, I did store some tomatoe sauce in one of the containers and it did not stain
 I purchased 5 of these dishes (at $9.99 each) to give as Christmas gifts.  Spode is manufactured in England, but the sub-standard knock-offs I received came from China. The color is dull and grayish. Return shipping would be outrageous, so I'm stuck with 5 ugly dishes.
 This phone would be great if it did not have the worst static come and go several times throughout a call. It never fails, when I need to make a really important call-- the static is so loud I can't hear at all. Every time we use it the static interrupts our conversation because we can't hear. And Target wouldn't take it back without the box--How long are we supposed to keep the box- reasonably!
 The design is ok. Nothing fancy, nothing different, it looks just like any other teakettle. It works fine. The handle doesn't get hot, and the whistle isn't too loud. I gave it one star because of the black goo that came inside. I washed it before using it, and after the water was done boiling, I saw little black particles floating in the water and the water smelled weird. The smell may have been caused by that black stuff. I washed the pot again and saw more black stuff coming out. I took one piece and noticed it was gooey. I checked if there was something that had melted when I boiled the water, but I saw the kettle was intact. I boiled more water and again I saw the black goo floating in the water. I have boiled water 7 times and have washed the pot 4 times, and there is still goo floating in the water, they are almost unnoticeable, like very tiny dots, but they are there. At least the funny smell is gone. I don't know what that black goo is or what's causing it or where it's coming from. I'm afraid it may contain dangerous metals or chemicals that can be harmful. If I keep seeing black goo, I'm sending it back. I think I've learned my lesson. When it comes to buying cookware, it's better to buy good quality. It's not worth jeopardizing your health to save a few bucks.Update: After washing it two more times and boiling water one more time I got rid of the goo. And I've noticed that the handle gets very hot when I fill it all the way up
 I have read a few reviews about this machine and some how I am not sure what I missed. I purchased this machine about 8 months ago. I loved the look of it in my kitchen with all my stainless appliances. That is where it ends.This machine has been terrible, when you put water in it the filter part floats up and out of the slot letting water get into the machine unfiltered. When your filling your cup you have to bend down in front of the machine to see where the coffee is in the cup or it will overflow, making more for you to clean up. I just want coffee!!!This machine has been terrible, when you put water in it the filter part floats up and out of the slot letting water get into the machine unfiltered. When your filling your cup you have to bend down in front of the machine to see where the coffee is in the cup or it will overflow, making more for you to clean up. I just want coffee!!!Even though the inside "unit" that holds the coffee does come out, it is not designed to fit into the front of a refrig to put water in it. You have to use something else to catch the water from the refrig then dump that into this machine. They put little time into the design/research of this machine.  I hesitate to add this as I don't want anyone reading this to think my home is dirty....living in Florida we tend to see Palmetto bugs. This machine has about 5 vent holes in the top of it, I had two bugs get in the machine. They had full access to the water reservior. Once I filled the water reservior the bugs came flying out. That was the end of this machine for me. POOR DESIGN ISSUES and not sanitary by any means. LOOK ON!
 I have had the Cuisinart DCC-2000 Coffeemaker for about six months or so and loved it.  This morning, however, it decided to stop working correctly.   I left the kitchen while it was brewing and all of the coffee leaked all over the counter.  What a mess!  I then made just 2 cups and put a coffee cup under the spout and watched it.  Sure enough as the coffee was brewing the spout was spewing.  I don't know what coffeemaker to buy now
 The cooking set looks great.  However, once you heat the pot/ pan, the steel material handles become super hot.  I have to return the huge box
 Granted I have never had feather pillows before so maybe this is what is to be eppected but they have no neck support whatsoever, they make disturbing crunching noises whenever I move my head and they positively REEK like a dirty henhouse. Gross! Home on the range ain't for me. I detest these, and threw them out
 I Love the way the Tefal deep fryer cooks, however, I am returning my second one due to a defective lid closure.  The lid may close initially, but after a few uses it no longer stays closed.  Since I have small children in my home, I will not be purchasing this one again. 
 Very disappointing!  Spend your money somewhere else.  I threw away a perfectly good but old made in the USA Thermos bottle and bought this made in China Nissan 0.79-Quart Stainless-Steel INSULATED Bottle back in June of 2005.  Ten Months later this bottle stopped keeping anything warm and would feel warm to the touch after you poured warm liquids in it - evidence of the loss of its insulating function.  I think it lost the vacuum in the cavity which I think is the method used to insulate the liquid inside.  When you spend $25 one would think it's a good quality product - Think again
 I bought this thermomter after watching Goods Eats with Alton Brown, because when I make buttercream frosting I wanted to be able to clip on the thermometer to the pot and get an accurate reading. Well this themometer did a lousy job at staying clipped onto the pot, it kept falling off no matter how I put it on. I even tried using other pots, but no luck. I am so mad that I paid so much money for this crappy gadget, it sucks
 I used this thermometer fewer than 10 times before it stopped working.  For the most part, it no longer registers any temperature, and when it does it reads 75-100 degrees too cool.  While it was working, I definitely preferred it to my analog candy thermometer because it was less bulky, but I certainly can't recommend it now.

 This is a neat idea ruined by shoddy manufacturing. First of all, this coffemaker is a lot bigger than most regular ones, especially the height. I can't fill this one without pulling it all the way out to the front of the counter. This takes up a lot of room for small kitchens or crowded countertops. The whole thing is also made out of plastic with a very cheap look and feel as soon as you take it out of the box. In just about 3 months of daily use, I've already had water or coffee leak out of the dispenser four times. Between the constant waste of space and having to watch out for leaks, I'd rather go back to pouring my own cups. The only reason I haven't thrown it out is because my wife bought it and I don't want to hurt her feelings
 I purchased this unit due to the fact that you could dispense without a coffee pot. In the past I have usually ended up breaking the glass carafe that comes along with traditional coffee makers. At first, I was very pleased with the unit and thought I made a great purchase. Eventually it started to drip and leak at random. The handle in the water/coffee holder broke. The top of the unit that lifts up broke off completely and now just sort of sits there precariously. Finally, this week it decided that it was not going to work at all. It will not make coffee. It will turn on, but not brew. I have only had this for a year and a half or so. Look elsewhere if you are looking for something that is going to last. (it was only used 2-3 times a week
 We received the Hamilton Beach BrewStation 12 Cup Coffeemaker as a gift from my sister-in-law.  She loved hers and had used it for a few months so she bought one for us.  Shortly after buying this for us, her coffeemaker started leaking.

The night before, I set it up and programmed it to make coffee at 5:00 AM - perfect, we could get up and have coffee already made.  It worked great.

You pour the water into the first reservoir (for water only) using the coffee tank to measure the amount of water.  The coffee tank is placed back on the coffeemaker and the coffee filter and coffee is placed in a basket that fits on top of the coffee tank.  The coffee is made and held in the coffee tank.  To dispense the coffee, you place your cup below the tank and push on the dispenser button with your cup.  Coffee pours right into the cup.

 My spouse operates this vacuum daily until the rechargeable nickel-cadium battery is dead to avoid any memory issues.  Like the Black & Decker 15.6V CHV1560 cordless hand vacuum, the battery life is 4 months tops.My spouse operates this vacuum daily until the rechargeable nickel-cadium battery is dead to avoid any memory issues.

 I have had this product for about 2 years.  When we first got it, it worked great--lasted about 10 min. at a time.  Now, we're lucky to get the floor cleaned up under the table before it starts to wear down.  Also, the clip which holds it to the base just broke, and I see that I am not the first person to experience this problem.  I don't see anywhere to buy a replacement base, at this time, so I may end up just throwing the whole thing away
 I am very disappointed with this product.  I was carving my Thanksgiving turkey yesterday when the knife stopped working after it got hooked on bone in the wing.  The motor continued to work, but the blades stopped moving.  The knife has only been used 3 times, but I had to throw it out today.  I opened the plastic case, and found a metal worm gear coming off the motor shaft,and a cheap nylon gear attached to it to move the blades back and forth.  The nylon gear was stripped and the knife was useless. My prior knife, much less expensive, lasted for 18 years.  The Cuisinart knife is not well made and only works well when it is not under any stress. 
 We have had this toaster for approximately 3 yrs.  It has had mimimal use as wevacation away from home in the winter ( 4 months at least).  There are just twopeople using this toaster and on an average only  use it twice a week.  The toaster isa part time toaster, sometimes it will toast both sides sometimes not.  It hasnow become a total pain as the mechanism to hold the bread down has stoppedworking.   I thought that a Cuisinart would last for ever.  I owned a very cheaptoaster for over 35 years, gave it to my sons to use in college.  That toaster stillfunctions properly but is small and a 2 slicer.  It will come out of the attic untilwe can find a better company than Cuisinart with a better product
 Zyliss makes different Shaker with different color.  If you didn't catch this review, it is just because this color is n/a.  They all leak.Zyliss makes different Shaker with different color.  If you didn't catch this review, it is just because this color is n/a.  They all leak.After 3 months of daily use, I feel bad that I have another thing to full up the landfill
 It has a terrible desing flaw. I use it to mix and carry protein shakes. I put the powder in, put the cap on and when i am ready put the milk or water, shake and drink. Too good to be rated 2 stars, isn't it? well that was the good.The bad is: the tread that hold the cap is inside the conteiner so when you mix, the mixture go thru the tread (it doesn't look nice), and it's supposed to be hold in by a clear tiny silicon-like band that is attached to the cap. If you tighten the cap too much, the band will be squeezed out of position and leak. If you do not tighten it enough the band won't seal and leak.Another thing, maybe not as important as the above, is that it is little uncomfortable to drink directly from the bottle, the lid keep closing everytime.So before you make your decision analize carefully. Despite all that.... It mixes, when you get it right(until the band break) and spray eventuall
 Unit is advertised as 5 quart............what arrived is 2 quart, and much too small for my purposes
 I have had the knife for a month, and now it is simply not sharp.  The knife does NOT hold it's edge, and I have used it only on soft vegetables a few times.I have had the knife for a month, and now it is simply not sharp.

 I bought this coffee pot after owning the older version of the grind and brew.  Silly of me to think this would be an improvement.  The front load basket design is terrible.  It is a true "pain" to clean this section, you cannot get your hands or any tool I have in my kitchen to clean the mechanisms.  Therefore, the brew basket sticks and at times the latch that holds the basket in will at times be gummed up.  Then when you start to brew your coffee thinking that the latch is closed, its not - its gummed up.  Not a problem until the heat and moisture from the brewing coffee loosen the gunk up and your basket shoots out and the coffee brews all over your counter.  As many times as hubby and I try to clean this its become too much of a pain, this coffee pot is out of here... and on its way to the curb.  I actually am contemplating sending it back to cuisinart in pieces!!!!!!Poor design.   Did I mention the coffee itself does not seem to have the same flavor as the other machine.  I think this one brews at a higher temp making the coffee bitter.Poor design.   Did I mention the coffee itself does not seem to have the same flavor as the other machine.  I think this one brews at a higher temp making the coffee bitter.My advise as a seasoned coffee maker/drinker.  PASS save your money and your headaches
 I am not a fan of the pause and pour feature. IT is a button and if the pot is not directly under button the coffe over flows. On two occasions the machine stopped dripping coffee in the pot, casing grounds to overflow the filter. I can only assume the pot was not perfectly placed. I searched for a red coffee maker at a resonable price but could find none without this type of pause and pour. I may have to remove button for 100% satisfaction. But I love the red accents in my kitchen
 I have been using a Brita pitcher for years but with the last two boxes of filters, a green slime grew in the pitcher after less than a month of use. I've heard the Brita faucet filter attachments are   worse. I'm looking for another product.
 i have wanted a crockpot for a long time and this one was one of the cheaper ones i saw.i've read reviews about rival before but decided to go ahead and try it out.i really wish i would have kept my receipt and box!.the lid doesn't even fit and moves around most of the time making a bunch of noise and letting all the steam escape so all your liquid ends up being gone.the food is well done before the slow time is up. my chicken turns out SO dry and overcooked.
 Wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this insane appliance.  Nothing "slow" about it-- burns everything, even on the Keep Warm setting.  Best you can get out of it is 4 hours before you absolutely have to return home and shut it off.  If not, your evening meal is small burnt pieces of food welded to the bottom of the pot. I swear, this thing is possessed!  My old Rival Crock Pot was the best appliance I ever purchased, this one is the WORST!
 I wish I had. This one goes to the Goodwill. Grill plates are fixed and a chore to clean. Grill leaves uncooked areas if height is irregular, like a chicken breast. Hamburgers work best. Watch out for burns
 I bought this iron based on the recommendations here and was terribly dissapointed. First of all, the iron is very big and heavy. That's not really a problem by itself, but when the iron leaves wrinkles on a shirt as much as it did, it becomes a big problem. The controls were hard to deal with. Turning the iron on and to the setting desired involved getting under the holder. I can see someone burning their hand on a hot iron by accidentally reaching underneath to get a grip in order to work the controls on a hot iron.I bought this iron based on the recommendations here and was terribly dissapointed.

 Maybe I just have stains that are too much for it, but this cleaner didn't seem to do very much, certainly not enough to warrant paying the extra for it versus normal cleaners. And I'm not using it on very old Le Creuset either, everything I have is less than a year old. Maybe it does better on older stains!
 The size is nice for 2 people.  Cleaning is easy.  Seems to be a defect in that the unit has to sit just right on the base or it will not go on and off by itself.  You have to juggle it to be sure it is seated just right to get it to come back on after the oil is heated up and then you have to be real careful that it stays seated just right. 
 These knives are terrible! The eversharp edge is finely  serrated and tears the steak leaving pieces of meat hanging on the edges. It rips the food instead of cutting it. I thought the Henckels name would be better than this. Don't waste your money
 As mentioned in a lot of other reviews, my water tank leaks like a sieve. the unit is completely unusable. When you see how poorly constructed the water tank is, you realize Hoover has built a clearly defective product. Save yourself trouble, buy another brand of cleaner. I will never buy a Hoover product again
 Is this some sort of sick joke? Are you purposfully trying to be politically incorrect or WHAT!? Making fun of sombody's disability like that is not funny and can produce long term mental anguish. If you're not careful, I'm going to take you to court
 My wife and I ordered 2 sets of the corelle ware. We even got a $10 discount automatically. The order came quicker than expected and everything was in excellent shape. We like this type of diningware better than china ware. It is virtually indestructible. I lkie Amazon's free shipping. I've purchased many things through Amazon and haven't been disappointed
 This grinder has a small capacity [not as advertised].  If you follow directions, it will only grind enough for 4 cups at a time. Also, for some reason it generates a static charge and there is coffee dust all over the counter after emptying it. The cord is stiff and the cord storage is inconvienient. Finally, it is much more noisy than my old one
 After reading the reviews here saying that the chemical smell mentioned by others was not a problem for them, I went ahead and ordered this rice cooker.  After I received the cooker, I was a little disappointed to find that it was made in china, rather than japan, and that there were some very noticeable imperfections in the fit and finish.

I made sure to remove the shipping paper under the pot, and wash the pot and lid thoroughly, but upon trying it out I was disappointed to find that my cooker did in fact emit an acrid chemical smell that filled my apartment.  It was the kind of smell that you more feel in your nose than actually smell.  The smell also flavored the rice, which was most noticeable after letting it cool and airing out the apartment. Aside from this problem, though, the rice, which was standard japanese style white short grain, came out perfectly.I made sure to remove the shipping paper under the pot, and wash the pot and lid thoroughly, but upon trying it out I was disappointed to find that my cooker did in fact emit an acrid chemical smell that filled my apartment.

I have compared a few rice cookers at my local asian store, and this Panasonic model seems better built than the newer (I believe) Panasonic SR-LA18, plus I believe it is made in Japan (I'll have to check when mine arrives).  I also highly recommend the Zojirushi 10-cup "Neuro Fuzzy" model (NS-JCC18/NS-ZCC18).  My parents have had one for several years and it works perfectly
 I loved this when I purchased it, then I noticed it did not do a perfect job, then it would take a while to get going, then it smoked and died.  Not worth it
 Took the blender out of the box. Cleaned the jar and lid and started trying to use.  It ran for a few seconds and then I started smelling something burning and the blender quit.  I attempted to contact customer support and couldn't get through.  The telephone message suggested I leave a message and they would call back.  I attempted to leave a message but it said the mailbox was full.  Not a good sign
 We have had this garlic press for a number of years, but now its handles have turned so gummy from repeated dishwashing that they turn the kitchen counter black just by laying it down. Plan on buying a new one every couple of years
 It is a strong knife; and easy to grip; but, I am upset about the rust spots on the blade, especially because I gave 2 people this knife as a gift!  It was very embarrassing!  I can't return it since it was a long distance gift.Shame on Oxo!   I gave it 2 stars because of the good grip; but, that is all it is....a good grip that looks like you bought it at Good Will
 I'm sure this is a fine pizza wheel. Unfortunately, I've not yet been able to use it, as the @#$!*$ sticker that came attached to the blade is vitually impossible to remove. Geez.
 After many years of loving Rowenta irons I have to say I am very disappointed the DX1700.  It has already "died" on me.  The first few months it worked very well.  The steam power that most Rowenta's have is great.  But I am very disappointed that it will no longer heat up. 
 The name Revere ware used to mean exceptional quality, now it means "Just more Chinese crap".The bottom is so thin it can't have the logo stamped properly.The redesigned handle has an impossible to wash void in it. In all fairness it is better than most imported junk
 I handwashed this one time and it filled up with water. I didn't expect to be able to wash it in the dishwasher but I also didn't expect it to fill 45% up with water the first time I washed it by hand. The water has since evaporated but I haven't tried to use the thermometer since and I won't use it without using a second one to calibrate this one to see if it is anywhere close to accurate. Not exactly what I was looking for
 This is warm, beautiful, soft and a fabulous bargain!  I highly recommend it... and buy the matching sheets!  They're a wonderful combination
 Only had this coffee maker ( second replacement) one year and it leaked from all over my counter. I asked for a replacement, crazy huh, and was told NO my time had run out. Well I am off on a hunt for a good coffee maker. THIS WAS NOT IT !! Do not waste your money
 Amazon couldnt send me the correct cutting board and they tried 4 times and now they want me to review this item that they never sent m
 These towels are soft and fluffy, but the towels are not absorbent. Just as other reviewers have stated, the towels don't absorb water, rather the water rests on the surface of the towels
 I bought it because of the rotisserie function, which I use a lot. This model has no variable temperature control on that function. There are some things I cook at a lower temperature for a longer time to get the proper doneness. I don't know why when they wired the machine they didn't route that function through the temperature control.
 I'm not sure who decided to put the word non-stick in the title of this griddle. It took me two days to scrape off the egg omelet that I tried to cook on it the first time. They should change the title of this item to Calphalon One Stick 10-Inch International Griddle. Do not buy unless you enjoy hand cleaning and scraping pots and pans
 This thermometer never worked correctly. For oven temps. over 350 the probe is worthless, it reads the oven temp., not the temp. of the meat.This thermometer never worked correctly. For oven temps. over 350 the probe is worthless, it reads the oven temp., not the temp. of the meat.Save your money and buy and old fashoined one
 This thermometer worked flawlessly for the first 3 months, then the probe broke. Don't ask me how it broke because I cannot see inside the metal do-hicky. A replacement probe is $10-15 provided you can find one. This thermometer worked flawlessly for the first 3 months, then the probe broke. Don't ask me how it broke because I cannot see inside the metal do-hicky. A replacement probe is $10-15 provided you can find one. It seems all these units have problems with the probes. Well, enough for me. I'll go back to my traditional thermometer
 First, when you use the temperature probe, the meat temperature shows on the display. Also, it is very easy to set the temperature alarm. However, there is a small switch that must be turned on to activate the alarm. Good for one burned roast. Granted, a mistake you will only make once.First, when you use the temperature probe, the meat temperature shows on the display. Also, it is very easy to set the temperature alarm.

 I was very unhappy with this product.  I ordered several cannisters and 3 out of 5 cracked after the first use!!!  I did everything that they recommended and they all cracked in the same manner.  The people at Foodsaver were very happy to replace them because they are under "warranty" but I am surprised to see how fragile this product is.  FYI, they will not warranty the products sold on E-Bay.  I should have listened to the reviews and not taken a chance on this product. 
 I got one with my foodsaver.    I like the foodsaver but their canisters crack after a couple of uses.   Also the manufacture is not handy friendly.   I was injured and can't speak.    When I tried to get help  by email they told me I needed to get friend or family member to call them if I wanted help.   That just wrong.   I guess they haven't heard about the equal access laws
 It says this is a 2 burner grill pan but that is so wrong. It does not cover 2 burners it sits in the middle of each burner causing the handles to be right ove both burners. Very dissapointing, I love the le creuset normally and was really looking forward to having a grill pan made by them. Unfortuanatelly due to the shape it will not work for just one burner either. Hopefully they will come out with an updated one, until then my search for a good 2 burner grill pan continues
 Made good waffles when I got it but now it burns them to a crisp.There is no adjustment on it to compensate for the ageing of the internal components.
 These tools, although fun looking, are poorly balanced and fall over if they don't have enough room to rest on the counter.  The handles are a little awkward in size and the bowls of the spoons slightly too deep.  I like their look, but I don't like the design of them
 I wish I had. This one goes to the Goodwill. Grill plates are fixed and a chore to clean. Grill leaves uncooked areas if height is irregular, like a chicken breast. Hamburgers work best. Watch out for burns
 This was supposed to be the toaster to end all toasters. We had it for about 2.5 years, and now the toast brown on only one side. The outer heating elements still work. The inner elements work at about 1/3 capacity of the outer ones. We now turn our toast around after a couple minutes to cook the other side. Until we find the next toaster to end all toasters. This one was not it!
 This is not a very good hot tea brewer.  The tea doesn't steep hardly at all and there is no difference between the strength settings.  The water is also not heated to boiling.  It is really just a glorified coffee maker.  You would be better off purchasing a more traditional teapot for far less money
 Worked like a charm until I put it through the dishwasher, and now it always exudes a fine black residue. Maybe some kind of rust? Can't use it anymore unless I want black grime on my ice cream. I have emailed the manufacturer to ask what's going on; haven't heard back yet
 I bought a set recently and unfortunatley it is made in china. We have some older ones and they are much differen
 I recently ordered a Pedrini Black & Satin Stainless steel Tomato Slicer through Amazon.com. The delivery was very prompt.  The slicer came with a clear plastic cover for the blades.  But the problem is that the tomato slicer is very dull.  The tomatoes are literally torn up by the time they are completely sliced.  I would not order another one by Pedrini.  I am not pleased at all with my purchase
 This is  a complete waste of time. This thing takes a lot longer than a traditional knife. The tomato juice goes everywhere and its flimsy. You actually have to saw and the blades bend like crazy. Dont waste your time or money
 The blade broke after 14 months of use.  And to take advantage of the warranty, I learned that I was required to send THEM a check for $4.00 for processing costs, not to mention the cost that I would incurr to ship it to them.  It was an adequate grinder at best, so I'm definitely not going to bother returning it (I assume that this is Cuisinart's reason for having such a lame warranty in the first place).  I wonder if the rest of their product line is like this.  Until now, I thought Cuisinart was a name you could trust.  I'm very disappointed
 I bought this vac to help clean up behind my 19 month old daughter and my 2 pets.  I used it once without a problem, seemed to work reasonably well for a hand vac.  The 2nd time I used it I was cleaning up kitty litter tracked from the litter box.  The 1st pass went fine but then as i was getting ready to make a 2nd pass to finish the job it started whining and it stopped working.  I turned the machine off, checked for any clogs or hair of any kind that may be causing the interference but i found nothing.  I manually moved the brush around a couple of times without a problem, so i turned it back on.  It was still not working and then within 2 seconds it started to smell like something was burning.  I turned it off and it was smoking pretty heavily, which lasted for at least 2-3 minutes before cooling off. Don't waste your $$ on this and more importantly don't risk your safety with this fire trap
 Who had the bright idea with putting the spout so low that this thing will boil thru so easily? since it doesn't make any noise that it is boiling, you know when the water start to burst thru the spout area and it is not a good thing. And what is up with the leaky spout in the weld area anyways? Welding is a skill that if done right, it would NOT leak! The handle will get hot so wear your glove. On the plus side, the stainless steel looks very nice which is why i bought it in the first place. I use to have a cheap tea pot that cost half the price of this one and it was more reliable (lasted 2 years) so that just goes to show that just because it cost more, it don't mean it would last longer. Mine start to leak after 4 months. I am going to buy that cheap one again if they still makes it.

 This kettle has so many design flaws I don't know where to start.  It doesn't whistle when it boils so if you leave the room you could have serious overflow before you get back.  The spout is at such a steep angle that it often pours beyond the cup.  The shape (especially the angle) of the handle means that it gets very hot -- I can't hold it without a pot holder -- and your hand gets scalded by the steam when you pour the water.  Mine also already started rust on the outside.I purchased this kettle about six months ago and I'm going to have to now buy another one
 Look carefully at where the spout is mounted. If you fill above this line, with the lid on tight, when it boils, boiling water shoots out of the spout. And the lid fits so tight it is hard to remove without burning.Look carefully at where the spout is mounted.

 I received the Delonghi deep fryer on Friday evening and had it at the post office on Monday morning.  I did everything EXCEPT stand on my head to get it to make potato chips...smaller batches, larger batches, shorter cooking times, longer cooking times.  What I did get, consistantly, resembled more a potato cake which was soggy in the middle.  I bought a Waring Pro at William Sonoma for $40 more and had beautiful potatos Monday evening.  Bottom line...Delonghi may be a bit cheaper and a tad easier to clean, but I want good tasting food
 This board scratches really easily, and mine had dings in it when it arrived
 I returned three Incantos, all for the same reason. The steamer stopped working on all of them after 3-4 weeks. It sounded like the pump failed. I replaced it with the slightly more expensive, older Magic Comfort Plus, which has worked like a charm
 This machine is the only sub-$3000 machine I could find that would make a cappuccino with the push of one button.  However, after an hour of trying, I could not get the machine to do anything other than display a message saying the grind was too fine.  The DeLonghi service number blamed it on the plastic float in the water reservoir, the simplest and cheapest looking mechanism imaginable.  I was having second thoughts about their quality control for a machine whose all-plastic construction did not inspire confidence to begin with, when the service person, after conferring with a colleague, decided there could be something more seriously wrong with the machine and that I should  exchange it.  Knowing that super automatics in general are not known for their reliability, I envisioned years of chronic problems with this machine.  I opted for a refund from Amazon instead and am relieved I did
 I bought one of your pans and I was so very careful with it only using plastic or wood  utensils. The pan has got big bubbles in it and the nonstick finish is pealing off. I rate this very poor
 Please do your self a favor and do not buy this item.  As a toaster oven it burns the bottoms of everything you heat in it.  As a toaster to toast bread or bagels, well it still has yet to toast anything for us.  You can run the toaster 6 times and it will never toast/brown.  I was shocked that this item would be so bad being that Hamilton Beach is a good brand.Something is obviously wrong with the production of this product.  Forget about purchasing this one.  If there was a zero for the star option on this product I would have given it a zero
 Although I love the way it clips onto the oven rack, and it's VERY easy to read, it took about 15-20 minutes to "register" the temperature of the oven.
 Contrary to the description above, this is NOT a non-stick pan.  I tried making eggs and pancakes on the pan.  Everything stuck to the bottom.  I used bacon grease on the pan before I made the eggs.  They stuck.  I used butter on the pan before I made the pancakes.  They stuck.Contrary to the description above, this is NOT a non-stick pan.

 I ordered the orange and the red.  The colors were much more drab in person.  The cumin is actually burnt orange from the 70s
 Thought for years, I was missing something by not having a Cuisinart!  What a laugh.  In the few months I have had this unit, two pusher assemblies have cracked and broken.  I did read the manual from cover to cover and watched the video prior to using.  This is an obvious design defect.  Guess I was lucky, in that first replacement was made without a hassle or having to return anything.  Now they want the broken item returned, which is an inconvenience and a delay.  I was without my replacement last time, at least six weeks.  I plan to return this item and purchase a different brand
 I had a Russel Hobbs electric kettle, made in the UK, which worked well for 3 years. When it finally died, I ordered one of these, based on the glowing reviews. It arrived new from Amazon not working. LF  Port Jefferson, N
 Maybe I just don't understand what this is supposed to do.  KitchenAid attachments are usually wonderful enhancements to their basic appliances.  But I haven't been able to create volume or foam in drinks with this attachment.  Can't see that it does much more than a spoon, and certainly doesn't do as much as a plain wire whisk.  It's not portable like those cheap, little drink mixers.  When I'm at home, I have my immersion blender  -  a much better option for mixing liquids.  Maybe this is good for something I haven't tried yet
 After 3 months of average use, this vaccuum stopped spinning the brushes. The canister is difficult to empty. I was very dissappointed because of the failure of this machine to last. I will never buy a hoover product again
 I LOVE THE COLORS AND THE HEAT RESISTANCE BUT FOUND THE WOODEN HANDLE ON ONE SPATULA ROUGH AND SPLINTERY.  ALSO THE SPATULA IS SHOWING NICKS ON THE EDGES OF THE SILICON....DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I DON'T USE IT ON ROUGH EDGED BOWLS OR PANS
 It picked up great but one month before the warranty expired the thing made terrible noises and didn't self-propel correctly. Sent it in for repair, took a month. They said "nothing" was wrong and sent it back, but now it works. I wouldn't buy another one. For $300 it should last more than a year before repairs are needed.

 Bought the vacuum on oct 1 2005.  Brought it back to the store on Oct 7th. The belt broke! Thought it was a fluke. Tried one more...Brought it back after 10 days.  A piece went flying after using the hose. the suction on the hose then did not work!  Overall the cleaning was great.... while it worked. 
 I bought this vacuum new and used it three times. For those three times, it worked like a dream. Never had the carpet been so clean. It even looked like a professional carpet cleaner had just visited. I bought this vacuum new and used it three times. For those three times, it worked like a dream. Never had the carpet been so clean. It even looked like a professional carpet cleaner had just visited. On the fourth use, the brush abruptly stopped rolling and the motor started smoking. It cost me over $100 to repair. Beware buying this vacuum; repair shop owners will laugh when you bring it in because they see so many of them with broken belts and motors. Ignore what consumer reports says on this one and most definitley do not throw your money away on this piece of junk
 First of all I'm a Dyson fanatic....I have a total of three (one on each floor).  When we bought our cabin I couldn't stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one (they are pricey) for carpet I'm on five or six times a year so I bought this.  At first I was thrilled.  It was wonderful.  After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction.  Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids, pets or real dirt.  I would doubt that it's on except that it's noisy and takes off without me.  I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked.  Also the "dirt container" is sometimes hard to remove and put back.  Feels like it's catching on something.  What a waste of money.  Even in my college days I've never had a worse vacuum.  I highly recommend the Dyson instead or even the $50 Dirt Devil I gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing.  To me "Hoover" spells "DISAPPOINMENT"
 This is the WORST vacumm cleaner I have ever had! It has continually broken down since I bought it and is now again dead. It's only 1 1/2 years old! While under warranty (the first year), I went through 5 belts, a roller brush, and the motor burned out. It is no longer under warranty, and of course, it broke down again. It smokes like it's on fire, and I believe that it's the roller brush *again*. Now mind you, my house is only 1600 sq ft, and half of that space is wood flooring, so I don't have an excessive amount of carpet. Nor do I vacuum excessively. Maybe once a week. I complained to Hoover and they basically told me "too bad". And it's not like it's an inexpensive vacuum at $289! This is the WORST vacumm cleaner I have ever had!

 Mine worked reasonably well for about 7 months; then stopped switching itself off and eventually overheated the plastic bulkhead which holds the coil, giving off a strong (presumably toxic) odour of melted plastic, also affecting the taste of the water. Amazon does not sell this item in Britain, where it would never get through the safety tests required by consumer legislation, but apparently they are quite happy to put American lives in danger
 I bought this item in October 2005, by January it had developed a crack across the bottom and up the side of the pitcher. I contacted both Amazon and Emile Henry about it.  Amazon will only give a partial refund and Emile Henry told me to go through the merchant and DID NOT offer that supposed warranty on their shoddy product.  Don't buy this piece of junk
 I got them free with purchase of Wamsutta sheets. These blankets are of really cheap quality. Thin, mesh-like texture. Threads get loose at the ends. Leaving traces of fabric everywhere. I got rid of it cause I am afraid the loose ends and fabric may be swallowed by babies
 The tea kettle is inexpensive, but I'd spend more to get a tea kettle that whistles and also has a top that flips open from the handle instead of one where you have to manually pop it off.  In addition, the handle gets hot, and you need an oven mitt to hold it
 Like many large wood surfaces, a peel is made from several strips of wood laminated together. However, this peel developed a split after just one use. The instructions indicate maintenance is achieved by wiping with mineral oil, so perhaps you should do this before using the first time. I imagine there are heavier peels available which may be worth checking out.I was rather dissapointed.
 This mixer has many speed settings, but they all pretty much go the same speed.  The "low" setting is so fast that if you are mixing much liquid it spashes all over.  I would not recommend this mixer, spend a few more dollars and get a better one!!
 The glass is quite fragile. I had two break
 The Breville chiller works so so based on the 6 minute claim the company states. To get it cold like in your refrigerator it took more like 14-15 minutes--still faster than a fridge though. Also, the description is sort of deceptive since it says new freezer gel packs, "no messy ice". I thought you just use these freezer packs and thats it--note you still need access to a freezer to freeze the gel packs before using. Also, you still need to add water and the freezer packs don't really last that long. If you want to chill more than 1 bottle, I ended having to use good old ice cubes since the freezer packs were spent. Its a bit messy trying to chill anything other than wine bottles since a typical drink can/bottle will be submerged under the water bath and the only way to retrieve it is to dunk your hand in the cold water. Also, if you are chilling allot of beverages, there is no way to pour out the excess water as the ice melts--they should put a drain spout at the bottom--I had to unplug the unit and dump the excess water over the sink. It does work being faster than your fridge or freezer, but the companies performance claims are a bit exaggerated
 I tried to chill my white wine in seven minutes and it was still warm. They say chill, but what does that really mean? They should say what temperature it chills to in 7 minutes. I guess that is why they have a 15 minute timer. Also the description does not state that you have to add water so it is just as messy as an ice bucket and as much work.
 The description does not tell you that you still have to add water to unit in addition to the gel packs. I chilled my chardonnay for seven minutes and it was still warm. I had to chill it for 20 minutes to get it cold enough to drink. Gel packs don't allow you to chill several bottles without having to refreeze them or add ice to the machine.
 It's great, if it works!!!  After keep exchanging it over and over, I gave up the 5th time. First time, spray didn't work, second time, power steam button didn't release the steam, third time, it was too strong fabric got stock underneath the iron and I couldn't clean the iron, fourth time, steam problem again, fifth time, steam problem again. Poorly tested product. I would've been really happy to keep it, if it was working properly. It actually had all the features I was looking for. Too bad for Rowenta for not testing their products properly.
 Cast iron is the only way to go when you are cooking on anything over 30,000 BTUs.  Lodge has a lock on this market.  Trouble with this wok is the sides are not high enough.  As soon as you start mixing, your food goes  sliding up and over the side.  Also, for the extreme weight, the handle  should be wider; distributing the weight a little more broadly for the weak  hand hold.  I gave mine away after three months.  I wish they would change  the design; I'd buy three
 I bought this thing due to my inablity to handle heat effectively anymore like I used to. The unit was not deffective or anything like that, but it also only works under very specific conditions and that window is small. While it is stated in the manual that it's not an A/C unit or super powerful and that it works off of evaporation. I found it to be nothing more than an inconvienance than effective. The fan at the back of the unit doesn't have enough power to move the lightest of feathers let alone allow one to feel anything. While the manual claims that the fan is for cooling the back of your neck I find it is more functional to the evaporation chambers. Overall, the unit just keeps your neck wet and doesn't really cool anything. I found that the unit did work a little more noticably if it was not that hot out and you stood still. Anything over 85 degrees and it fails.Don't waste your money on this thing until someone comes out with a better system
 I should have listened to the other reviewers, which I usually do. I followed the directions to the letter. Put it on in 95+ degree weather and never felt cool at all. In fact, after several minutes I actually felt hotter and was sweating as much as without this thing on. Even if it had worked, it was very uncomfortable. I am suprised that Sharper Image sells such a bad product
 Very disappointed- Feels cumbersome around the neck and blows very little ai
 first 5 minutes: feels like having a cold towel on your neckafter 5 minutes: feels like you are wearing a warm/hot wet block on your neck 
 I live in New York City where the temperatures and humidity are high. All this does is make your neck feel cold. I was still sweating after an hour! Try it if you want. The Sharper Image has a money back guarantee for 60 days. I dont know about Amazon
 After one wash cycle, these sheets split at the seams.  Otherwise soft and comfortable
 I cannot recommend purchase of the refurbished Roomba Discovery 4210. While I think the product did a good job on BARE floors (not carpet), now after only 4 months of light use (we only used in the kitchen/den area of our home), the unit is trashed. The refurb warranty is only 90 days and that's apparently all the machine is good for. I purchased a new APS fast charger in an attempt to rule that problem out, but it did nothing. This seems to be typical of this vacuum since the Roomba rep I talked to told me that if the charger failed the Roomba was "probably trashed". She was right. If you want  to try this machine stick with the new one, at least you'll get a one year warranty. But I recommend staying away altogether
 Roomba was given as a gift to me. Not only is it noisy, but it took 2 hours to do my small house with 3 rooms closed off to it (about 1000 sq ft). It takes me 15 minutes to swiffer the house. It missed a LOT of areas. Yuck
 Works well and looks great but lifting is not fun.  If you are a weight lifter always looking for a few more reps for your wrist elbow and shoulder get this kettle.

 I've had this kettle for less than 2 years. After reading good reviews, I decided to purchase this kettle because I wanted something that would last with daily use. I disliked it from the beginning. Why? 1) It's heavy. 2) When you open the lid to fill it with water (you shouldn't fill it just through the spout because then all the deposits are on the wrong side of the filter), water that has collected around the lid leaks out and runs down the outside of the kettle. 3) After less than 2 years of use, it is no longer working properly. It constantly switches off during heating. I've had better use from a cheap plastic kettle, and will be going back to using one of those
 What A JOKE!!! This whas a disappointing experience. The Garment Steamer never really worked. I wasted a valuable time in this deal. I bought one at target first missing parts then I went back returned it and came back home to use it and again never worked. What a WASTE of my time! The second GARMENT STEAMER ONE and OFF button kept turning off about one minute never producing any steam. I tried to contact customer service to find out if I was using it right and customer sevice is no HELP AT ALL! MY ADVISE IS: PLEASE DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME WITH IT. Sincerely,&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62;&#60;br /&#62;Jackeline De Ranier
 Although I ONLY hand washed these pots and pans, somewhere between the 2nd and 3rd year, the nonstick coating on the pans started lifting.  I also do not use metal cooking utensils.

 I purchesed this product not too long ago and whoever disigned it should take a look at the silverware basket.  They sould come up with a better way to drain the silverware because the silverware basket hangs over the counter in every position I tried.  Needless to say, I took it back because the basket would have drained my silverware all over my counter and not in the drain board. I think its a nice dish rack but the basket has to be redisigned to drain in the drain board and not over the counter. Looks are very decieving, in the picture it looks like the basket is over the drain board but its not.  I hope this helps others before they decide to buy this product
 I ordered 2 sets of four in case there was any breakage...and guess what...1 ramekin was broken leaving me with 7 dishes.  To top it off, a few days later, I found a comparable set, slightly larger, at Big Lots, for only $7 for four.  Of course this is always the risk we take through mail order...often it is not worth the time or trouble to get refunds or replacements
 We had to return this item for a refund. It arrived and never worked.
 The first time I used this yogurt starter and it did not thicken I thought that it was my technique.  After reading and making several sucessful batches using store bought yogurt for the starter, I tried another batch using the Rolmex starter purchased at the same time as the original failed starter.  The results were the same:  no thickening, just liquid.  Others seem to have had good results so it is possible that the culture I received was not properly stored at some point before I received it or that it was just a bum lot
 I get this thing and they forget to tell you about the big bulky power cord its impossible to feed the fish and a number of other problems
 I purchased the Melitta Mill in April, it's now July and the thing is shot.  We used it daily to grind 2 tablespoons of coffee, first the switches stuck and then we had to plug and unplug it to run the thing.  Sure it was inexpensive, but you should get more than three months out of the purchase.  $6+ a month just to grind coffee?  Don't buy this poorly constructed product. 
 I received this grinder because I had purchased a defective Melitta Grind & Brew coffee maker through Amazon.  The coffee maker had electrical problems and I sent it back to the manufacturer as the manual instructed.  To make a very long story short---Melitta was not able to replace the coffee maker.  They stopped making them.  Amazon had my money and I waited over 4 frustrating months for a coffee maker.  Amazon would not help me and after many, many phone calls Melitta sent me another coffee maker and the coffee mill to compensate for the Brew and Grind.  Grinder malfunctioned periodically and finally died with in 9 months. WARNING--DON'T BUY MELITTA PRODUCTS AND RETURNS FOR DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE SHOULD BE RETURNED TO AMAZON. 
 I, too, am SO disappointed with this product. When our DeLonghi toaster oven died after 15 years, my husband and I went shopping for a new one. Numerous reviewers and salespeople informed us that DeLonghi toaster ovens just weren't as good as they used to be, so we decided to try the KitchenAid oven. It appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we'd always been satisfied with. The oven, which was bought from a major retailer, looked fine, but the timer and bell were out of synch. Even worse, while the top coils heated up nicely, the bottom ones heated very unevenly. KitchenAid Customer Service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense. Less than a week later the new oven arrived. It looked perfect. But again, it didn't work. This time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up. After preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner's manual, we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom. Now we'll have to return this oven as well, and we've pretty much given up on getting a KitchenAid one at all
 The product is labeled as a seed grinder, so you would expect it to be able to grind seeds, but it failed miserably. I tried grinding flax seeds (about the size of sesame seeds) but about half of the flax seeds made it through the grinder intact. I even tried running the "ground" seeds through a second and third time but still wound up with a large portion of whole or almost intact seeds. That was with the grinder on the fine setting. It seems to be a combination of poor design and cheap parts. The "grinding" wheels are made of plastic which is not the best material for friction and the design allows a lot of the seeds to drop off the wheel into the chute without having actually been "ground" by the wheels. If you're wanting to grind a very small amount of seeds, try a manual grinder. If you're wanting to grind a medium to large amount of seeds, spend more money and get a proper flour mill
 The decription says it is a 9x5 loaf loaf dish.  I was thrilled. I have been looking all over to find one that size in glass.  I was so mad and disappointed when I opened the box and it was 8.5 x 4.5.  That wasn't what I ordered.  And yes when baking bread there is a difference.  I am still waiting on my postage-paid return label so I can ship this back. This would have been a great deal, except I already have the 8.5 x 4.5 pans.  They need to change the dimensions in the description.  Buyer beware!
 We bought this to replace our 25 year old can opener after the blade on it snapped.  We looked around and quickly discovered that finding an inexpensive opener was easy but a quality opener was going to be a difficult task.We bought this to replace our 25 year old can opener after the blade on it snapped.

At first it seemed "ok", but after just a few months we are back to using our old "manual - hand wind" opener.  The reason is that the top lever is too cheaply made and it flexes.  Over time (not much time!) it gets too loose to hold a can anymore.  We lock it in place, it spins an inch or two and the can drops onto the counter.  Repeat this scene over and over...!  At the end, the lid is never (REPEAT - NEVER!) separated from the can - ever!Out of shear frustration we ended up selecting this Black & Decker.

 No I don't think it's the problem with my washer and dryer, they are new units. Now only with great difficulty can I put them on my queen bed. and they claim they have deep pockets! I do believe it is a quality problem
 I was so happy when I received this sheet set. It looks beautiful (that's the reason why I am still giving 1 star). But after a couple of nights of use the fitted sheet became ruff. THEY PILE!!!! If you are looking for comfort - as anybody who buys a 1000TC sheet set is - don't bather with these. Spend your hard earned money someplace else
 I'm normally a fan of OXO products and own many of their gadgets. These measuring cups are the first problem product I've had from OXO...both the 2 cup and 4 cup sizes cracked on the bottom of the cup, right at the plastic injection point (that little circle with the tiny bump in the center of it), and they both now leak at the crack. These cracks developed very soon after I bought them, and I only ever washed them in on the top rack of the dishwasher. Because of the design of the cups, it's kinda annoying to wash them by hand - and they're not great for measuring dry ingredients for the same reason. So mine have gone into the garbage can, replaced by the KitchenAid cups of similar appearance (although without the handy interior measuring marks). My advice, keep your receipt if you buy these. Or skip them and get the KitchenAid, which have a non-slip rubber ring on the bottom, another nice feature. And they won't crack in the dishwasher
 I have bought flannel sheets from Amazon before but they were from Martex and they were greate. But, these are just bad. They are too thin to start with, left lint all over the bed and even after washing they have left fuzzies all over the sheets, I cannot even explain how bad it is. I  should have waited for another Martex deal
 Product not even worth a penny. Impossible to use after the first wash..Wont recommend to anyon
 I bought two sets to take advantage of the free shipping, despite the low reviews. (I plan to buy good sheets once they go on clearance at the end of the season...) When I took one set out of the package there was already a hole in it. Amazon replaced them, but when I washed them they feel like they are going to fall apart. The filled up the lint collector. I have red and green lint everywhere, even after washing them. You get what you pay for

 I have depended on my French White - the "old" style - for many years.  I went to buy a few new pieces for myself, but discovered that Corning has changed the design.  "French White" is now nothing more than cheap-cheesy-heavy-porous-breakable stoneware.  I saw many chips and even a crack in the display models.  STUPID Corning! They seem to have forgotten that Corningware was designed to be the smart alternative to that cheap-cheesy-heavy-porous-breakable stoneware!  PLEASE SAVE YOUR $$$
 I have tried to like this pot - in theory it sounds great, but in actual usage, it is very problematic.  The non-locking handles are the chief drawback - you need to awkwardly hold them closed with pot holders while draining - and the acute angle needed to remove all the water inevitably means leaking hot water on to the holders and hence on you.  Back to the tried and true colander in the sink for me
 Although I ordered the juicer in the color black, I received the product in white.  If not for the color I would have purchased it locally.  After approximately 6 months of satisfactory occasional use the juicer is no longer functional.  Some of the teeth on the gear that is connected to the press lever have broken off.  I had expected a product this simple would have lasted for years.  I am obviously totally disappointed
 I thought I was getting a good deal with this deep fat fryer but the quality was really poor.  I used the fryer only once because the lid did not seal properly and I ended up with oil & water from condensation dripping down the side.  I returned the product and received a full refund.  The safety plug was hard to use and the basket size is too small for more than two people
 it simply doesn't do the job. only bruises the herbs. i normally love oxo products, but this one is a disappointment
 I loved this when I purchased it, then I noticed it did not do a perfect job, then it would take a while to get going, then it smoked and died.  Not worth it
 I purchased a few of these for myself and friends. From the day I got my spoon spatula it was my favorite kitchen tool, especially since I could use it when making sauces or frying onions and veggies. One day when making a non-meat tomato sauce the handle simply broke off leaving the handle in my hand and the spatula in the pot. I wrote to OXO about this twice in the last 2 months with no reply and this is most frustrating to me. Anyway, I am now using a KitchenAid product which feels much more sturdy and KitchenAid responds to e-mails IMMEDIATELY
 The very first cut I made on this cutting board left a huge gouge in the surface.  Subsequent cuts also left deep marks.  For something that's advertised as being harder than maple, I found this to be very surprising.  Maybe it's the way it's put together?  All I know is that this cutting board is on pace to be the shortest lived ever in my kitchen.  Pretty much the only thing that I like about it is that bamboo is a renewable resource.  Good thing because at the current rate, I anticipate needing a new one very soon
 I have the large one tried to use it on coffee.... can't get it to work. Love the rest of the products

 ... I returned it without even using it because it did not feel like a quaility item.  I would not recomend this product if you have any taste
 Like most reviewers, I found these glasses to be elegantly modern and sleekly minimalist.  Like a number of other reviewers, I found that one of my glasses leaked.  Unlike one other reviewer, I was unable to eliminate the water between the glass' walls in the microwave, and when I tried to do so the glass became very hot because of the steam produced.  To my mind, elegance of form can never compensate for a failure of functional design.  5 stars for form, 1 star for function:  2 stars total.Like most reviewers, I found these glasses to be elegantly modern and sleekly minimalist.

Neither did, and they're a pleasure to use.  I recommend local, rather than web, purchase
 I got this pasta maker as a gift, and after the first use the knob used to set the thickness of the pasta broke off and so did a piece of the handle used to turn the rollers.  All it would make after that is a flat piece of pasta with varying thickness.  The company is going to charge me to send it to them and back, even if they decide to exchange the product, and all correspondences must be done by mail (no call-in number) so I'm not even hopeful for an exchange

 Doesn't work. Not worth the postage to return. The foil cutter works, though...so if you want a really expensive foil cutter with a free paper weight, this is for you!
 I have to admit that this is not as handy as I hoped.  It is big and clumsy and it's a little too flexable
 After me first coffeemaker began leaking- and it was a realtively new proctor-silex 12 cup maker- I decided to try one of these "cute" single serve ones.  Why, oh why did I purchase this brand??  First, it does take around 3-4 minutes to brew a single cup of coffee or tea.  This seems like a longer time than most.  And now, after 2 or 3 frustrating weeks, it's leaking just like the old one did.  Not user error, as the water comes from underneath the coffeemaker.  Also, the coffee is not coming out as hot either, which causes me to wonder if it's the heating element...  Even though this one can use loose grounds or pods, it is not worth the frustration!  Try a different brand.  My sister-in-law has really enjoyed her Sensao!
 Absolutely horrible! The worst $20 I've every spent.  This machine is an absolute waste of money.  I have had this machine fore 2 weeks and still have not found a cup small to fit it, they are all either too wide or too tall. A total headache when your rushing out to work
 When something says 'white' I sort of expect to get something close to the colour white. I ordered three of these plates but they are closer to beige. They also have an odd matte finish that made them seem cheaply. However, they are large plates and at this price, probably good for entertaining if you need quite a few. The large ones would be good for holiday meals - those times when you really need extra serving pieces that you don't use the rest of the year
 The tumbler that I have is sold in various places as the '360-degree Dribble-Proof Tumbler', I am not sure if that is the same as the JMT401 but on paper the specs and features are the same.  It is not a good design for car use.  On the plus side I like the no-handle design and it has a small base which should fit most cupholders.  On the down side you need 2 hands to twist the lid open or closed.  Also the 'dribble-proof' design means that the mug has a very deep lip, and even when it is full you have to tip it far up and into your field of view to get the liquid flowing
 Looks great in my kitchen but I, too, only use it for shakes & smoothies.  It DOES smell like burning rubber nearly every time.  I used to think something was wrong with it and now I just disregard it.  And after less than two years or making smoothies, I'm replacing the blade & gasket assembly. 
 We have owned this blender for about 3 years. If I had to do it again I definitely would not buy this blender. First, it is very loud. The timer quit working and the band rivets around the jar are rusty. The only things I like about it are that it is easy to clean and the jar is nice and big. Other than that don't waste your time
 This is our fourth new blender in the last three years.  My wife and I prepare one large smoothie everyday that has no ice, but lots of frozen berries, fresh fruit, etc. Nothing else goes in the blender. This blender looked nice and was so heavy it implied quality. It even worked great for a few months. Then one day the gear that delivers power from the base to the jar stripped right off. Now it is out of warranty. This is not simple to replace since the plastic/rubber piece separated from the steel shaft. We paid close to $100 for this thing so spending a couple of hours bringing it to someone who will charge $25-$50 to repair it seems like throwing good money after bad.

 It leaked from the bottom seam the first time I used it.  But I guess you get what you pay for. 
 This was the single worst set I've ever used. If zero stars would be an option, that's what I would have chosen. The pot broke before we could even dunk a peice of bread into the cheese. While it was warming on the stand it came with, I heard a sickening crack, so I immediately (tried) to take it the pot off the stand. The ENTIRE bottom of the pot and split away from the side...and cheese oozed everywhere on my counter top. This was the single worst set I've ever used.

 This item was broken when it was received.  It was not packed properly
 It's not made in Germany that's for sure, it's made in China (like everything nowdays) and I was really looking for German quality.
 OXO usually makes great things, this sifter does the job, but if you're making something large be prepared to be there awhile. It's very slow and after awhile your arm will start to tire. I would not recommend this sifter, just too slow for even making a small batch of cookies.
 I have never written an online review for a product before, but I am so annoyed by this dumb sifter that I just had to. I am not a "speed" baker of any sort, but I have four kids and do like to make birthday cakes, muffins, cookies, etc. My old sifter was so old it was getting flecks of rust into the flour, so I started looking for a new one. I chose this one after reading all the online reviews, and even though I saw that a few people found it slow, I was not prepared for how slow it really is! I just sifted 3+ cups of confectioner's sugar for cake frosting and it took over five minutes. As another reviewer said, in order to make it go faster I shook more vigorously and then had to keep changing hands because they got tired. (I have never ever been tired out from BAKING before, fer' pete's sake!!!) I'm not convinced that the people who designed this product have ever actually USED a sifter. I'm stuck with the thing now, I suppose, so I'll learn to just go slower. But it is literally about one tenth the speed of my old sifter - which was just your typical grocery store thing with a crank on one side. The one thing I really like is the caps for both ends - an innovation I'm surprised nobody else has come up with. But that doesn't redeem the product for me. In fact, if I can put my hands on another one of those old-fashioned ones (at a thrift store, maybe) I'll snap it up and put this new one in the Goodwill bin.
 Amazon should discontinue sale of this item as replacement batteries are not readily available
 After using this product twice I was extremly disapointed.The drip tray does not catch all the dripping from frying bacon.The grease ends up all over the counter and melting the base unit that the drip tray fits in.  You would think Wolfgang Puck would try this product under all conditions to make sure it is enginered corectly.  My counters are level so this is not an issue.  I am a dissatisfied customer.
 I purchased this item from a well known home shopping TV show.  After 4 months, it's no longer working.  Also, it is advertised as being able to be put into the diswasher.  I have an average size diswasher and it DOES NOT FIT!!  I have contacted the manufacturer and will return it for repair or replacement! I purchased this item from a well known home shopping TV show.

 Item was not the one ordered, I returned it and the reolacement you sent was also incorrect. I returned this second item for credit. You had placed your sticker with bar code over the manufacture's bar code and your label was incorrect. I hope you correct your error before you send several custmers the wrong ite
 I bake a LOT of cookies.  I love my mixer but and concerned and disappointed in this piece of equipment.  It peels and chips constantly and those pieces of plastic paint mysteriously disappear into ???????     How can they sell this type of faulty equipment
 I bought this product thinking that it would be better than the cordless spotlifter that I had previously owned. The "powerbrush" just grinds in the spot and water flow required to loosen the stain must be hand pumped a little squirt or more accurately a dribble at a time. The prevoius cordless spotlifter pumped large amounts of water under pressure and made the clean up much easier.Also the suction is lousy compaired to the old cordless version. Once the spot is wet and loosened there is not sufficient suction to pick up the water.I'm sorry I bought this product. It does a very poor job
 There's hardly any suction. I applied a full tank of cleaner on the carpet (which requires a little effort one squirt at a time), but it only sucked up a few drops of it.  customer service was helpful and had me return the product
 The slow cooker worked well the first time I used it.  The second time, the light turned on, but it never heated up.  I was disappointed, because the size was perfect for me.  I'll try another brand
 I have had these for about 4 months (I own every size made), purchased to go with the other Kitchenaid pieces (in red). It is impossible to get these white again after using them to cut cheese, carrots or anything with any natural coloring in it. I have tried cleansers with bleach, sprays with bleach and, in desperation, straight bleach! Scrubbing doesn't work either. I finally got some wood cutting boards and wish I still had my so attractive other ones on the counter.
 I'm surprised you requested this review because I returned the item.  They were just what I wanted, color and all, but when I tried to put the dinner plates in the dishwasher they only fit if I placed them using two spaces.This reduced the dishwasher capacity.  Next problem surfaced when the samedinner dishes didn't fit in my standard sized kitchen cabinet
 I bought a Haier RTC1700SS oven from Amazon about a month ago. I am still waiting for a replacement from Haier because the trays & spit did not fit.I hope by this summer I will know what it's like to cook on a con- vection oven. I'll let you know if I ever get a chance to use the one I've already paid for
 I bought one and the plate that diffused the air was off center so it baked unevenly.  I called and was told it was a defect and would do a warranty exchange.  I was under the impression they would send it out but when I called, I was told I was supposed to send in $14.95 for shipping or I could give them a charge card and they would charge it again to ship out a new one and credit when I returned it.  The new unit I received has had problems with the digital timer displaying the timer but rather than  to have a short so rat her than do the return thing again I just used a manual timer.  It baked a bit more evenly and was fast but still needed to rotate pans. I just recently had a power spike that took out all electronics plugged in, including the oven but I doubt I will reorder this product.  Too unpredictible. 
 Beautiful to look at, BUT, I agree with other reviewers that buttons are difficult to operate and don't even work sometimes, plus be prepared to change batteries every few months--ridiculous for something that uses TWO lithium batteries and is not in heavy, or even everyday use
 I have this scraper and after just a few uses, it fell apart at the connection in the center. Normally, I rave about KitchenAid, but this product was truly a disappointment
 I have several other silicone spatulas, and this Kitchenaid scraper is, by far, the worst I've used.  Most silicone scrapers are soft and flexible, but this one is very stiff and rigid, so you cannot scrape containers out very well at all.  Honestly, it doesn't even appear to be made of silicone.  Cheap grocery store spatulas work much better than this one.  Very disappointing
 when this arrived I was very pleased with its quality-color-packaging -everything.Only problems is that after a short time using the plates I noticed scratch marks-dark ones in the center of the plates-I would guess from where people used their dinner knives to cut their food--very disappointing-as I was ready to buy the entire collection-glad i waited.
 I bought this because it had such good reviews... I got one and used it a few times perfectly without problems. until it blew up in the microwave. yep, BLEW up. Now Im sure i did everything as i was meant to.. so i really am being objective about this review..I bought this because it had such good reviews...

Now Im sure i did everything as i was meant to.. so i really am being objective about this review..what can i say? this was my experience, ive decided to buy a more reliable egg cooker which does not involve the microwave..
 I found this product cumbersome, and the instructions for assembly, battery replacement, etc. were not very clear. The vacuum didn't hold a charge well, and it was hard to remove the batteries for replacement. I finally gave up altogether and bought a different product
 I bought this and some other pans in the set.  Very disappointed.  I have a glass cooktop, and when the pans heat up, they warp. Then return to their normal shape when they cool down. Guess I got what I paid for
 The battery is way below standard, extremely disappointing. It's cheaper to buy another machine than to replace it
 This product stands up to heavy use without fraying or melting. My only complaint, and it's a significant one, is the shape of the handle.  I find it awkward and clunky.  It's probably great for people with larger hands.  I've decided to replace mine with cheaper ones.
 The handle is big, bulky and heavier than need be. It's like picking up a hammer

I would have returned it but for the price didn't think it was worth the trouble.  So I just tossed it.  Maybe mine was defective but I doubt it
 BUYER BEWARE! I agree with the other reviews, these plates are BEAUTIFUL! Great size and shape.  However, I used them for the first time last night at a dinner party and the bottoms of the plates and cups are so rough they scratched my solid oak, espresso stained table!  Each place a cup or plate was set that wasn't on a placemat there were small scratches left behind. If you always use a table cloth or have a granite or stone table they would be fine, but I wouldn't ever put them on a quality wood table again. Fortunately Amazon makes returning easy
 We like the features and performance of this oven quite a bit.  We bought it to replace a regular old toaster oven.  The T-Fal toasts very evenly and I can fit a whole frozen pizza in it!We like the features and performance of this oven quite a bit.  We bought it to replace a regular old toaster oven.  The T-Fal toasts very evenly and I can fit a whole frozen pizza in it!The bad part is that after about 2 weeks of service, the controls work only very intermittently.  This means that all functions behave at their default settings--no temperature or time adjustments.  Luckily, the default setting for toast is just barely on the brown side for us, still edible.  It's annoying to have what is otherwise a fine oven so befouled by unusable controls.  It would have received a 5. 
 This brews great coffee; unfortunately I have gone through 2 of these in 3 years. Not heavy use either. On my first one it started to leak the water from the bottom, and now my second one doesn't grind anymore. Still makes a good hot cup of coffee thou
 My knives started to rust after 3wks of use.  I didn't put them in the dishwasher either.  I just leave them in the sink w/the dirty dishes till I'm ready to wash.  But that shouldn't be the problem.  I have a cheap $3 butcher's knife from chinatown that hasn't rusted yet and I treat that one the same
 I used this dough blender for not even 6 months, and the handle snapped! (mind you, I am not a pastry chef, so I was not using it everyday. I used it a handful of times.) I understand it has a 5 year warrenty, so i will try to get it replaced. I have to say that it worked great before it broke
 I am an avid cook and baker.  I used this unit twice and it broke after the 2nd useage. I found it to be very slow; the charge didn't last long so I had to keep it plugged in.  The dough had to be very very soft in order for the press to produce the cookies.  I am very disappointed that such an expensive item would operate so poorly
 I was really looking forward to receiving this, but four weeks after purchasing online, I received an email from Amazon saying they did not have a supplier for my purchase!  I am disappointed in Amazon.  How can you sell something you do not have
 I have to echo some of the other customers' negative sentiments below - this thing never really worked well.  Recently I noticed it had completely died; I think I used it all of 6 times.  There have to be better models out there - I wouldn't recommend this one
 My rack came with pieces warped, one screw and most screw holes missing. Wood split as I was putting it together.  Used it once for drying pasta, then once for kindling. Hope you have better luck
 This blender is very weak. It has a small blade that cannot pull down anything of substance and I had to stir even soft fruit in liquid or it would never get cut up -- just the bottom part of the mix spins around. I used this blender four times since August 2006 (when I bought it) to make 'smoothies', always with poor results. As the other reviewer said, the fruit stays lumpy. The little blades aren't strong enough. Yesterday I wanted to liquify some cooked potatoes for soup. Of course they are thick and starchy, but after the usual 'stirring' to get them to move through the blender, the speed buttons started to vibrate and I could smell the unit getting hot. I wasn't overworking it -- mainly pulsing and then running it for about 30 seconds. All of a sudden, it wouldn't work any more. It just burned out. If you actually cook and expect a blender to blend things, don't buy this blender. I'm going to see if Amazon will take it back. (Note: after I wrote this, I was told by Amazon that I had to get in touch with the manufacturer, which I could do because it was within 90 days of purchase. However, the company wants me to mail in the plug and $5 for 'shipping' to get a replacement, which obviously I don't want. Why would I want to pay $5 more for a product that didn't work the first time? Why would I want the product again at all? Amazon would have taken it back, but they wanted it returned in the box, which I threw out. I'm even more dissatisfied with this product now than when I wrote this review originally. Maybe I can make it into an interesting planter and sell it at a craft fair . . . 
 I suppose this will actually peel garlic, if you use it just right. Never, ever, ever get it wet. It will not work. Also, you must trim off both ends of the garlic, or it won't peel. And then, I still have to hand peel some of the more stubborn pieces. It's just not worth the money. If you look around, you can find much cheaper garlic peelers out there.....BUY THEM!

 I bought this teapot from Amazon in 2005 and used it numerous times.  The material is great, heat retention is good, it looks very nice, and I had no problems cleaning it (I use a babybottle brush).  I bought this teapot from Amazon in 2005 and used it numerous times.  The material is great, heat retention is good, it looks very nice, and I had no problems cleaning it (I use a babybottle brush).  The tea infuser is not very effective though.  The holes are a bit on the large side, so any broken bits from whole tea leaves can still pass through.  And the infuser is too small for my taste to allow proper steeping of all the tea leaves, especially when I'm not planning to fill the pot to the brim (it doesn't extend deep enough).  So I don't use it at all (I put the leaves directly into the pot and use a strainer as I pour).The tea infuser is not very effective though.

So you have drops of tea trickling from the spout to the bottom in between pours, ending up with a wet spot on your table/counter.  I have to make sure I either wipe the spout in between pours, or set it on a dishtowel/paper napkin (unless I'm planning to pour tea to multiple cups in one session).

 Yes, it is pretty. No, it is not a good teapot. I have made tea for over 40 years, in all sorts of pots, and this is right up there with the worst. It drips A LOT! Perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout. And no, it does not drip from the spout. Rather, lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot.  This happens with both fast and slow pouring, with full and near empty pots.  This teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot. Just too much mopping up
 This is NOT Aubergine, a dark purple like the color of eggplant skin, but it is a light, bright purple. Sitting on my kitchen countertop, it is a very formidable sight first thing in the morning; glowing, shimmering in kitchen flourescent lighting. Caveat emptor, unless you're color blind or really like bright purple
 We love this machine, but it continually breaks down. The plastic parts are too brittle for the pressure that this pasta maker places on them. We have waited many times for parts, and we have waited too long on the service line needing help. We love this machine, but it continually breaks down.

 I sent it back because the shaft that was supposed to fit down through a hole DIDN'T, no matter how I considered the matter, so never tried it, sent it back, asked for a refund. :-(
 Took what I thought would be a nice set of sheets to my place in Costa Rica and have slept in wrinkles ever since. Hard to maintain, color is not vivid and am overall disappointed with this 600 thread count sheet set.
 You can buy this at Walmart for $78.00. The seller here is charging $89.00 plus $26.00 shipping. You can buy here for 115.00 or go to Walmart and get it for 78.00.Also, seller misquoted price on this item and when he realized this he cancelled my order through amazon.Will not buy from this seller again.This new seller who sells on ebay also is not getting off to a very good start
 I thought "KitchenAid" this has to be a keeper. I was wrong. The handles are much too heavy. There's too much give with the spatulas. I find the utensils to be too bulky and uncomfortable. I'll stick to my other much cheaper temperature regulated utensils
 I bought this box about 4 months ago and stopped using it about 2 months ago. It turned out to be more work than just a regular box. At least you can wash out a regular box and start over clean. Good luck with completely cleaning all the poo crumbs from the sliding track and cheap gears. It gets to be a disgusting affair, more than with a regular box.

As other reviews said the rake only goes over the top half of the litter so there's tons of sticky cement left at the bottom which you have to manually scrape out. It was often unable to push the clumps into the bin. So it would just very noisily push until it got stuck, back up, and then start over again like 10 times in a row. When it does get clumps into the bin, it also pushes tons of litter through the crack between the bin and the box and then you're left with a huge pile of litter underneath the box. To clean it, you have to take it apart. The top part houses a computer so you can't soak it which means there's poo always stuck in the crevices. Ever see Office Space?

At the end of two months I was ready to bring this thing out in a field and bash it with a sledgehammer. Now we're looking for another box. Currently, we are just using the plastic box from the littermaid without the rake, etc. This is my worst investment to date.

 I had been looking for egg rings (without knowing what such a thing was actually called) for a long time before I happened upon these babies.  As soon as I saw them I knew they were exactly what I had been looking for and ordered them on the spot.  Unfortunately, my glee turned sour when I tried to use my new egg rings.I had been looking for egg rings (without knowing what such a thing was actually called) for a long time before I happened upon these babies.

Eggs stick to virtually everything, and these rings are no exception.  Trying to remove the ring and flip the egg is a pain, usually I flip the ring and the egg flips with it, and then I have to cut the egg away from the ring so it falls down to the pan
 Well, it started off a fairytale.  This small vacuum has a lot of power.  Unfortunatley, I think I have permanant hearing damage from the volume of this vacuum.  It is EXTREMELY loud, it terrified my pets and I had ringing in my ears after using it.  It worked very well for about 6 months and then pooped out on me.  I'm not sure if the motor gave out or what, but the suction doesn't work even though the brushes still spin.  THE FILTER IS A PAIN!  I run a rabbit rescue and deal with a lot of pet hair, it just clogs up way to fast.  If you have a small apartment with merely area rugs, this might be ok, just make sure you buy some ear plugs.  YIKES.
 This egg slicer would seem to be a smart design since it will do slices and wedges.  However, the wires consistently get snagged in the slots and break.  Also, it does not accomodate jumbo eggs well. 
 The way specifications were mentioned it sounded a good deal, and price comparision made it more real, but after getting the item I found that it's true: Low Price, Low Quality... Don't fall for this deal. I am disappointed
 This product is junk.  I like most oxo products but this one is poorly designed.  The hadle is spot welded and can not hold any weight.  My second one broke after shaking the remains of a stock out.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
 I've used these type of units all the time until I got my own.  It stopped sealing, and I haven't had a chance to use up the bags that came with it!  When I called, they said it was probably the heat tape that went bad and they can't fix it.  They offered to sell me a new one though!  I have no idea where my receipt is (my fault).  I have to have another one, so I'm going to buy the cheapest one so I don't feel so bad when I have to replace it in 6 months to a year
 When I received my set of Mini Springform pans I was very excited.  I couldn't wait to get started on some wonderful deserts.  And as expected the results were great.     Only after the first washing did the problems reveal themselves.  Not only did I notice rust on the release hinges, but the rims on the collars were warped.  At first I thought I could live with this, but a friend pointed out it could only get worse.     I am used to purchasing top quality kitchen equipment, but these definitely do not make the grade.  Admitedly the results of my first time use were great, but I just don't feel these pans will last.     I hate buying something and knowing I will have to replace it soon.  And that is exactly the way I felt with these pans
 I purchased this after looking at all of the reviews. What a mistake! After using this to cook single cup servings of several types of rice, there was one thing in common - a huge mess. Even after rinsing the raw rice several times, the unit still spatters out to about a two foot radius. I may try it with a wet dish towel on top to contain the mess, or I may just stick it in the basement and forget about it
 This carafe keeps beverages warm enough.  The problem I'm having is the push button on the lid sticking in the open position.  The instructions that accompanied the carafe address this issue, although they were written for a different model that has the push button on the top of the lid.  Despite following these instructions the push button still sticks.  To get the lid to close now after I'm done pouring I have to release the button and smack the top of the carafe.  Very poor design in my opinion.  I wouldn't buy another Zojirushi product based on this experience.
 Simply put, it doesn't work. Well, perhaps it can work on some types of fabrics/garments in very specific (or limited) situations, but it didn't work on mine. Simply put, it doesn't work.

 I have purchased this item twice. The first barely made it through a grill season and the second proved even less hearty. The grill gets too hot for the wire and it burns through leaving two pices of probe wire. There is no way to use this with a grill and get sustained use from it. The same is true of all brands.. Models sold as "wireless" are not wireless in terms of going from the meat to outside of the grill.  Somebody needs to figure out how to make this tool without the probe wire. That said, before it becomes useless, it works really well. Maybe the idea is to buy these by the case?
 I've had 4 or 5 of these thermometers over the years and when they work they are great. But inevitably the probes fail. You will think its your fault and probably buy a new one. But the reviews show that the probes are not up to the temperature extremes they will be subjected to in a grill or an oven.I've had 4 or 5 of these thermometers over the years and when they work they are great.

But the reviews show that the probes are not up to the temperature extremes they will be subjected to in a grill or an oven.One solution I've tried that works pretty well, is to keep your receipt, and when the probe fails, take it back where you bought it for a replacement.
 While it worked, it worked great.  But then it stopped working.  Only 10 months of use.  Ordered a new probe, but that didn't work.  Now, it's just an expensive timer.  Would've received three stars, but the Polder site and service not helpful.  Will try the Taylor model, good luck with analog Taylor thermometers.  Once you get used to these types of thermometers, it's hard to go back.  The precision in cooking, especially for chicken and pork, can make a big difference
 I purchased this wok for my husband's Christmas present.  It was lovely, we cooked two meals in it Christmas day.  Nice heat transfer, beautiful on the table (but big).  That night, he noticed the handle was cracked where it meets the pan.  It's considerably narrower than the normal Le Creuset handle.  Back it went to Williams Sonoma, where there were a few other L.C. woks with similar cracks!  Phooey to you, Le Creuset.I purchased this wok for my husband's Christmas present.

 We received 3 sets of this for a wedding present.  I really liked how the polished silver shined and how they felt in your hand.   However,  after just one wash there were quite a few that had rust spots.   After two more washes the rust got worse.  These are supposed to be dishwasher safe!  There are recommendations to hand wash these and dry them, but who has the time for that these days?  Despite the apeal of the set, we decided to try something else.   It's a shame because it's such a pretty set (before the wash of course!). 
 I bought two sets of these about 4 months ago.  After the first time in the dishwasher I noticed little tarnish/rusty looking spots.  They rubbed off fairly easily, but as time has gone by, they are looking very bad.  Tonight while eating, I got a sliver in my finger from the fork!  I have NEVER had a piece of flatware peel.  I'm going back to my old flatware.  Sure glad I saved it!  DON'T BUY THIS JUNK
 True, these sheets do get rather wrinkled in the wash, however, that isn't my concern.......True, these sheets do get rather wrinkled in the wash, however, that isn't my concern.......The description states that these sheets will fit a mattress up to 14 inches thick.  My pillowtop mattress is about 11 inches thick and these sheets don't fit!  I washed them in cold water and used the lowest dryer setting.  What a pain
 This press doesn't seem to work well.  The top browns much more quickly than the bottom.  Clean up isn't all that easy.  I was surprised by how small the grill surface was
 We had this machine at work and made maybe 6 cups a day on a busy day. Within a month the machine broke - Keurig did replace it right away but then the second broke as well (a co worker bought one for his home and had the same problem!!). they gave us an upgrade on the model and this one is still going. The Coffee was good but the tea was not. Most importantly people is IT IS WASTEFUL. WITH LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS FILLING UP THE GARBAGE, AND IN OUR CASE TWO MACHINES IN THE DUMP. COME ON PEOPLE LETS HAVE SOME CONSCIOUS COMSUMERISM AND SLOW DOWN. What ever happened to putting the coffee in a paper filter and pouring hot water over it and letting the fragrance wrap around you. If you are that busy and needy for coffee instantly maybe you should be looking at the job ads or self help books and not over priced hunks of wasteful plastic for greedy americans
 I bought this pan because it was non-stick, plus it had the air cushion between the layer of steel.  I bake my usual brownies and cookies and they all stuck to the pan.  It stuck more than my glass pyrex casserole pans.  It was not easy to get it off, I had to scrape it off and it took time and a bit of muscle.  Definitely not non-stick.  The air cusion works from preventing the bottom of the cookies from overbrowning, which is not exactly a great idea since the top of the cookie become significantly more brown than the bottom of the cookie, which sometimes is moist and not quite holding the cookie together.I bought this pan because it was non-stick, plus it had the air cushion between the layer of steel.

 We just replaced our entire kitchen dishware with the Sango Brown - Mistake...even bought the added pieces...well, we ONLY hand wash them (we have a dishwasher but rarely use it).  In the first week, a plate broke in half right down the middle...then a week later, a second...and tonight, a third..all three directly down the middle of the plate while HAND washing..(not rough washing either).  I have a call into Sango and hopefully they will resolve it.  After reading the reviews here, I would have to agree that its not worth the danger of broken dishes (My wife sliced her finger pretty good on the second broken one) to buy these.  I am going to try to find a set that will go with ALL THE EXTRAS I bought from Sango..I am HOPING I don't have to replace everything!  What a mess!  Sango, why cut corners on such a beautiful set??  Im at a loss here to figure out that business logic
 I was disappointed with the spatula.  It is too flexible and too large for my hand.  My husband thought the size was okay but he too thought it was too flexible.  It reminded me of a diving board
 These sheets are not quality. They are no way equal to the value that the seller has assigned to them. The jersey material is very thin and the construction technique is inferior. They are NOT a bargain
 i agree these sheets are horrible.. i should have know better..  I have the same issues as every one else does..  I dont know what will happen after the second wash.. They will proably fit the crib.. i agree these sheets are horrible.. i should have know better..  I have the same issues as every one else does..  I dont know what will happen after the second wash..

 I wish it was possible to give less than 1 star!  Went through dishwasher once, came out rust!  Save your money....or your packaging!  I thought Chicago cutlery; how can I go wrong?  so out the packaging went!  I called Chicago Cutlery.  Turns out some of their stuff is now made in China. Wouldn't that make it China Cutlery?
 I was very pleased with the Le Creuset baking dishes I have (I have the Poterie 10" x 13" deep dish baker, 14" oval baker, and 9" square dishes as well as this one).  However, my 12" dish just cracked down the middle while I was cooking a pork roast in it at 425 degrees.  It had only been in the oven about 45 minutes.  I am sorely disappointed and now I am wondering if I wasted my money on the others.  I have only had it for about 2 1/2 months
 I have owned this breadman for one year.  I make between one and two loafs of bread per week.  Mostly whole wheat bread.  I purchased the 900S because my previous machine was a breadman and it performed well (8 years).Pros:It makes a good loaf of bread.Good selection of cycles.Loaf is easy to extract from the pan.Loaf is easy to extract from the pan.Cons:The motor is not very powerful.  It lugs down when making whole wheat bread.After 7 months of operation the Teflon wore off the mixing paddle.At 11 months the bearing failed in the mixing pan.At 11 months the bearing failed in the mixing pan.Overall I am disappointed in this bread machine and I could not recommend it
 Not sure how other people have been able to make a real loaf of bread with this, but I certainly could not.  I made three attempts, all failures for various reasons.  Either it did not mix, or the dough was so hard it knocked the pan off its base, or it created pebbles of dough.  It definitely can not be left unattended, which defeats the purpose of delay start.  It bakes OK though, but you better do all the upfront work yourself.  PS. I was using the recipes that come with the maker
 We liked the idea that the caraffe didn't need to be heated from below... a big plus with this unit.  But.... we have had some serious problems with the filter backing up and the water leaking over the top of it everywhere on the counter.  A FLOOD of coffee.  We thought that it might be the filter holes were clogged... so we made sure they were rinsed out well and could easily flow a stream through them.  But then we had a flood again on the counter.  So we thought that maybe our filters were'nt good... so we bought other ones.  And them we had another big flood of coffee (this has proven to be very staining to our white grouting).  So we thought perhaps we were grinding our coffee too fine and it was packing down too tight.... so we ground it coarser... and yet, ANOTHER DANG FLOOD. We have followed the instructions perfectly... and still these overflows.We liked the idea that the caraffe didn't need to be heated from below... a big plus with this unit.

 From the start, it was apparent that the temperature displayed was 5 or 6 degrees higher than two other digital thermometers I had in the same room.  So I followed the calibration instructions and was only able to get the display to read 34.1 degrees in a 32 degree solution... ok, so I can live with 2.1 degree inaccuracy.  After calibrating, the room temperature was also only off by about 2 degrees.  However, I decided to test it in boiling water and the display read 193 degrees (water boils at 212F).  So, If you are counting on this thermometer to tell you anything important (such as if your meat is cooked suffiently or if your beer water is the right temperature for steeping), I would make sure it is accurate at the temperature of interest before using... or avoid it all together, which I wish I had done
 in defense of Amazon.com, the pan was not damaged during shipping.  It appears that the nonstick surface has been gouged on both pans.  I just got a refund.  Poor Quality.  Don't waste your time
 I wish I'd read the previous reviews! I ordered this for $14.99 as a &quot;bottom of the page special&quot; and it's going back. It is not two inches thick as described, but 3/4&quot;. What a disappointment! And now I see that the regular price has been changed from $25 to $40. YIKES! Don't bother..
 All four glasses arrived broken.  They are not packed for shipment.  I have tried three times to get Amazon to refund my money but I have had no luck.  Heed the warnings
 Now, i love the idea of having a chrome tub caddy until 2 months into having it, it begain to rust. Then the candle holder & the wine glass holder rusted off !!! I am now on the looking out for a plastic covered tub caddy. A caddy is awesome to have but not in chrome !!
 I bought three of these when I saw them in a local store, thinking them a great deal. They LOOK like the equivalent of the Henckels, solid and sturdy, at one-fifth the price. Looks can be deceiving. They are suitable for paper, skin, aluminum foil, etc., but do not try them on anything more substantial, like chicken leg bones. I broke these on items that I routinely cut through with my Henckels and Wusthof shears. The cost of sending them back under warranty was about the purchase cost, so I tossed out all three pairs.

Sorry, Chicago Cutlery, but if you are selling office scissors, label them that way. I expect kitchen shears to be a LOT tougher, so I can't mark these more than one star. Chicago Cutlery makes a pair of scissors called the Insignia series, for only about $2-3 more. I suggest potential buyers look into these, or spring for the more expensive German brands
 This product is sick! If you get a "delight" out of seeing an fish hung  like a Christmas decoration in a ball that is way too small too  live in your sick! Plus a nightlight? Try sleeping w/ no eyelids w/ a light over your head. Fish sleep too, but  they cant close their eyes. There does not even seem to be much air space above the water. It's the same problem with those silly bowls with the plants on top. They breath oxygen and sufficate witout fresh air. Get at least a five gal. tank and don't waste your $ on this cheap fad product. Bettas are so smart, fun and sociable and desarve just as much respect as all of our fellow pets and humans
 This mixer is so weak it couldn't mix air. It's horribly under powered. Seriously, it bogs down mixing mashed potatoes, and I'm talking INSTANT mashed potatoes! And mix protein drinks?? Forget about it. It leaves clumps because it doesn't spin fast enough. I'd do better twirling my finger in the glass.This mixer is so weak it couldn't mix air. It's horribly under powered.

 I agree with the other reviewers; had the machine for a couple weeks, after 5 uses the machine didn't sit right on the base, causing the teeth between the base and the container to grind a bit.  After that, it was all downhill.  The base teeth were completely ground down within 2 uses.  Interestingly, the new back to basics smoothie machines seem to have a better locking mechanism, and teeth that seem to be made of more durabe material
 I had this machine for about 3 years with no issues. But, how often do most people use their machine?  I used it maybe 15 to 20 times.  I went to use it yesterday and all of a sudden I see smoke and the bottom of the machine and that funny electric smell (We all know what that smell means) The plastic bottom of the base stuck to the machine and margarita's were everywhere (except in my glass).  We had to throw the whole machine out.  Now I will be buying a new machine, being that I enjoyed the convenience of the spout but if I can't find one thats non plastic I will use my blender.  The smoothie maker makes less of a mess for drinks, a blender always doesnt pour as nice. I will not buy another plastic model again.  (I believe this one was a gift to me)  Do yourselfs a favor and spend the extra cash on a metal version or even glass if this exists, obviously the motor doesn't last long and the plastic parts break to fast according to other reviews I've read. 
 I bought the Back to Basics 600 smoothie maker about 6 months agos.  I was pleased with it until the plastic toggle on the spout broke.  It is made of plastic and apparently could not withstand the tension on the plug.  I was very disappointed since I use it every morning but thought it would last longer.  I will look for a better quality one next time
 I am a quilter and was looking for a good hot iron and lots of steam. I also hate the auto- shut off. Well I thought I had found it. The perfect iron for my needs. Well after only one days use it is put away for someone else to use I was very disapointed in the iron it spits water and boy do I mean spit my ironing board cover was wet. My fabric continued to to roll under the iron, the surface is not smooth and seems to grap the fabric. Not what I was looking for at all I would not recommend this iron
 I have had this iron for awhile now.  The big problem is that gunk builds up on the soleplate that is almost impossible to get off. Except when you iron white shirts, when it seems to rub off of the collar and seams, permanently staining and thus ruining your shirts.  Avoid this iron at all costs
 I was very disappointed with the Cookie Maker Plus and I believe I bought a defective product. The picture on the front of the box shows the person's hand on the big button to make cookies, I had to use the small button at the top to get it to work and the big button to retract the plunger. I have used the Cookie Maker Plus 4 times... twice to make twice baked potatoes, once to make candy but the 4th time I used their recipe for Classic Spritz Cookies the machine died after 16 cookies. I switched the batteries and it produced 2 more cookies , then died again. I finished the batch by rolling them out and using a cookie cutter. The Cookie Master Plus could use major inprovement. Don't waste your money.
